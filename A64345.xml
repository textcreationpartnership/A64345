            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Neither did I propoſe to my ſelf to make the Eulogy of the Great Virtues, which are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous in your Excellency, ſuch an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king is above Vulgar <hi>Pens,</hi> and too great to be Treated in the narrow bounds of an <hi>Epiſtle De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory.</hi> Whoever attempts that, muſt give a Relation of the Sieges of <hi>Candia, Athlone, Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, Limerick</hi> and <hi>Cazal;</hi> Deſcribe the Bloody Batters of <hi>Aghrim</hi> and <hi>Landen;</hi> Relate the Important Negotiations committed to your care, ſpeak of the Prudence, Intrepidity, and Bravery you have expreſſed in the greateſt Dangers, and commend, in Terms ſuitable to the Subject, that admir'd Penetration and Sagacity of your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, which diſcover'd the Secret Intreagues of a Court, notwithstanding the moſt refin'd Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation that ever <hi>Italy</hi> made uſe of. Theſe great Qualities are ſo well known, that Envy and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie are forced to be ſilent, and dare not attack a Merit esteem'd by all the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and admir'd by all the World.</p>
            <p>I am afraid that I ſhould diſpleaſe your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency by proceeding any farther on this Subject, yet I would beg leave to obſerve, that theſe great Vertues are hereditary in your Excellency, and not the effect only of an happy Education. My Lord Marquiſs of <hi>Ruvigny,</hi> your Father, was
<pb facs="tcp:63304:4"/>equally fit for Council and Action. His great Courage and Prudence raiſed him to the Dignity of Lieutenant General of the Armies of the <hi>French</hi> King, and would have certainly advanc'd him to that of Mareſchal of <hi>France,</hi> had not his Religion, been an Invincible, tho' Glorious Obstacle to it. Every body own'd he deſerv'd that Great Truſt, and his Prince thought he had no Subject in his Kingdom ſo fit to Repreſent His Perſon in the Courts of the greateſt Kings in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Excellency will pardon me if I cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to carry the Parallel ſomewhat further, and therefore, my Lord, give me leave to ſay, That you are like him, <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Charitable:</hi> You both Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly quitted a Great Estate; and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Life, with the Teſtimony of a good Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, had more Charms with you, than all the Dignities and Dazling Splendor of a Court. You are, as he was, Senſible of the Miſeries of the Poor: They had always Acceſs to your Perſon, and were never ſent back without Relief: The <hi>Widows</hi> and <hi>Orphans</hi> find in your Excellency what they have loſt, and the Prayers of ſo many Relieved People ſent up to Heaven, fall down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon your Excellency in Showers of Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings.</p>
            <p>But what ſhall I ſay of the Vertues of my Lady <hi>Marchioneſs</hi> your Mother? It is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to draw her Character, without Exhausting all the Qualifications aſcribed by <hi>Solomon</hi> to his Virtuous Woman.</p>
            <p>The Merit of your Excellency is ſo generally known, that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> have Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded

            <p>Though <hi>Poland</hi> is not very Remote from us, yet one may ſay, it is almoſt unknown, few Perſons going thither to Travel. However, it deſerves our Curioſity, it being one of the moſt Ancient States of the World, the only one which has Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved and Maintain'd the Right of Electing their Monarchs, and indeed the only one that was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Conquer'd.</p>
            <p>The Original of the <hi>Poles,</hi> as well as other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is very uncertain and Fabulous; but the <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matians</hi> are ſo Ancient, that there is ſtill ſome Monuments at this day, that <hi>Jupiter Belvs,</hi> one of
<pb facs="tcp:63304:6"/>the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Monarchs, made War upon them, though Unfortunately. The <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> were not more Succeſsful againſt that Warlike Nation, nor even the <hi>Romans</hi> themſelves. They had nothing to do with them till <hi>Auguſtus</hi>'s time, who Beat them off of the Banks of the <hi>Danube. Domitian</hi> was very Unhappy againſt them; and, in ſhort, it does not clearly appear, that any of the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours penetrated into <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> no not <hi>Trajan</hi> Himſelf, though <hi>Eutropius</hi> relates, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived under his Protection a <hi>Sarmatian</hi> King. <hi>Adrian</hi> allow'd them a Yearly Penſion; <hi>Marcus Antoninus Pius</hi> took a greater Care to Defend the Empire, than Inlarge its Bounds; and as to <hi>Marcus Antoninus</hi> the Philoſopher, he was not able to Compaſs the Deſign he had of Reducing <hi>Sarmatia</hi> into a Province of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. <hi>Maximin</hi> had no better Succeſs againſt them; and ſince his time the Empire declin'd apace till <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> reviv'd their Spirits again. This Great Man Subdu'd the <hi>Germans,</hi> and gave the <hi>Sarmatians</hi> ſo many Overthrows, that they were forc'd to quit the Territories they had Uſurp'd during the Reign of His Predeceſſors. They were again Defeated by <hi>Diocleſian</hi> and <hi>Conſtantius;</hi> but it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that they became Subjects to the <hi>Romans. Valentinian</hi> Defeated them ſome time after, in ſuch a Manner, that they were forc'd to quit <hi>Panno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and <hi>Moeſia,</hi> and Retire into their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and Began to Form a Common-wealth under <hi>Lochus,</hi> about the Year of our Lord 550.</p>
            <p>They have preſerv'd their Liberty ever ſince, though they have been often reduc'd to great Extremities; but they never paid Tribute to any of their Neighbours. 'Tis true, that their King <hi>Michael, VVieznowisky,</hi> had the Weakneſs to agree to Pay a Yearly Tribute to the <hi>Turks,</hi> but the States of <hi>Poland</hi> refus'd to Ratify the
<pb facs="tcp:63304:6"/>Treaty, and boldly Aſſerted their Right and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty under the Conduct of <hi>John Sobiesky,</hi> Grand Mareſhal of the Crown, who was afterward Elected King, and forc'd the <hi>Turks</hi> to Renounce the Pretended Tribute that <hi>Michael</hi> had Promis'd them.</p>
            <p>The Nobility of <hi>Poland</hi> is ſo Numerous and Brave, that it ſeems Morally Impoſſible to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer their Country, ſo long as they are well Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the Surpriſing Progreſs of <hi>Charles Gu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtavus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> who, in Three Months Time, Conquer'd almoſt that Kingdom, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing in this Caſe, for that Prince was called in by ſome of the <hi>Polanders</hi> themſelves, and the others would not Fight for their King. The Precipitated Retreat of the <hi>Swedes,</hi> when the <hi>Poles</hi> Returned to their Duty, ſheweth, how little they were able to Conquer <hi>Poland.</hi> But I leave off this Subject to ſpeak a word as to this Book.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Conſtitution of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Government, and the Principal Officers of State.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>POLAND</hi> is a Republic compos'd of two Eſtates; the Crown, and the great Dutchy of <hi>Lithuania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Crown is properly the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Poland;</hi> and the great Dutchy of <hi>Lithuania</hi> was United to it in the Year 1386. by the Duke <hi>de Jagillon,</hi> who embrac'd the Chriſtian Religion that he might marry <hi>Hedwige,</hi> Daughter to <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Hungary,</hi> and who with his Religion changed alſo his Name, and was called <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iadiſlaus.</hi> For the <hi>Polanders</hi> were Chriſtians long before, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving received the Faith of <hi>Chriſt, ann.</hi> 964, in the Reign of <hi>Mieciſlans</hi> I. who after he had divorced ſeven <hi>Pagan</hi> Wives, was converted, and marry'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63304:10"/>the Daughter of <hi>Boleſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Bohemiae,</hi> who was a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>Theſe two Eſtates are contiguous to one-ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and are now but one Body, being united in the ſame Intereſt, under the Government of the ſame King, and in the Profeſſion of the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; eſpecially ſince the Diet held at <hi>Grodeck</hi> on the River <hi>Bug,</hi> between the <hi>Polanders</hi> and the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> in the year 1413. where the Union was renew'd, and where it was concluded, that for the future they ſhould have the ſame Laws and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges; and that the King ſhould be elected by the joint Conſent of the Nobility of the two Eſtates, which was ratified and ſigned by all the Senators of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs they are governed by diſtinct Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, each of them having a Grand Marſhal and a Petty or Sub-Marſhal, whom they call the Marſhal of the Court, a Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, and Treaſurer, who are all Senators, thoſe of the Crown for <hi>Poland,</hi> and thoſe of the Dutchy for <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and are equal in Dignity and Power; only thoſe of the Crown take place of thoſe of the Dutchy.</p>
               <p>The Office of the Grand Marſhal is to keep the Peace, and prevent Tumults or Diſturbances both in the Diets and in the King's Houſhold, to puniſh Offenders even with death, and without Appeal from his Judgement, except in caſes of great Importance, which may be brought before the King. He has alſo Power to command Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, to give leave to ſpeak, to introduce Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors, to appoint them their Lodgings, and to fix the prices of all Commodities and Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes. This laſt Branch of his Authority is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly advantageous to him: for the Merchants give him very Conſiderable Preſents, that they may have leave to ſell their Goods at exorbitant Rates.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63304:10"/>
               <p>The Chancellors and the Vice-Chancellors of the Crown are choſen by turns out of the Clergy and Laity: But thoſe of the Dutchy are always Lay-men. The Chancellor and the Vice-Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor make uſe of the ſame Seals, and either of them may be uſed indifferently; for they have both an equal Authority, only the latter gives place to the former, and never gives judgement but in his abſence. The Chancellor, by his Office is the Judge of all Civil Affairs, and matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Kings Revenue. 'Tis alſo his Duty to take Care that nothing be done contrary to the Laws, or Injurious to the Liberty of the People, and that the Intrigues of Foreigners may not be prejudicial to the Republick.</p>
               <p>The Authority of the Chancellors and Vice-Chancellors is ſo great, that in ſeveral caſes they may affix their Seals, without the Kings Order, and refuſe to ſeal ſuch things for him as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Conſtitutions of the State. 'Tis the Office of the Chancellor, or in his Abſence, of the Vice-Chancellor, to anſwer all the Harangues that are made to the King by Ambaſſadors; and he of the two who is a Clergyman, hath power over the Secretaries, Prieſts and Preachers of the Court, and over the Ceremonies of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Treaſurer is properly the Keeper of the publick Treaſure, which is brought to him by four other Officers, who keep an exact Account of it, and are obliged to give one Copy to the King, and another to the Treaſurer. His Office impowers him to prevent the waſting or embezelling of the Revenues of the Republick, and of thoſe which are appointed for maintaining the King's Table; and therefore he ought to ſign all the Contracts the King makes, which otherwiſe would be void: He ought alſo to take care that the Republick do not ſuſtain any damage by the

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:63304:12"/>of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Order were driven out of <hi>Syria</hi> by the <hi>Saracens,</hi> they were received by <hi>Conrade</hi> Duke of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> and Brother to <hi>Leſcus</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who finding himſelf unable to defend his Country againſt the continual Incurſions of the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous <hi>Pruſſians,</hi> called in thoſe Knights to his Aſſiſtance in the year 1228, promiſing them half of what they could Conquer in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> and in the mean time putting 'em in poſſeſſion of the Province of <hi>Culm,</hi> till they ſhould be able to make themſelves Maſters of ſome part of the Country. This was the fatal Spring of all the Differences which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd <hi>Poland</hi> in a War that was carryed on with ſo Obſtinate a Fury: For the Knights of the <hi>Teu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonic</hi> Order, grew at laſt ſo Formidable to their Neighbours, and by ſucceſſive Victories rais'd their Power to ſuch a heighth, that after they had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued all <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> they gave many Battels to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who could never utterly expel 'em, tho they ſometimes obtain'd conſiderable Victories over them, as in the Battel which <hi>Jagillon</hi> fought againſt <hi>Grunwald</hi> and <hi>Tanneberg,</hi> in the Year 1400.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Knights were ſo proud of their new Conqueſts, that forgetting their Original, and ſcorning the humble and ſamiliar Name of <hi>Brother,</hi> with which their Religious Conſtitution oblig'd 'em to content themſelves, they began openly to claim the Title of <hi>Lords,</hi> notwithſtanding the pious Zeal of their great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>

               <p>Theſe Knights aſſum'd ſuch an abſolute and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent Authority, that they would not ſubmit even to the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the Popes; for <hi>Locticus</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> having ſent to <hi>Avignon,</hi> to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, that theſe Military Friars had uſurped one of his Provinces: the Pope order'd 'em to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it, upon pain of Excommunication, but they had ſo little Regard to his Menaces, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus'd poſitively to quit their Poſſeſſion.</p>

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63304:15"/>great and frequent Revolutions, <hi>Poland</hi> has had its ſhare in the general Calamity, and is at preſent confin'd within much narrower Bounds: For it may be obſerv'd in general, that every Republick is look'd upon by its Neighbors as a Country which they have a kind of Right to invade. And the ſame Remark may in a peculiar manner be apply'd to <hi>Poland,</hi> both with reſpect to the Manner and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of its Government, and the inſatiable Ambition of all its Neighbors, of which the <hi>Turks, Tartars,</hi> and <hi>Moſcovites</hi> are moſt formidable.</p>
               <p>'Tis long ſince the <hi>Turks</hi> diſmember'd <hi>Valachia</hi> and <hi>Moldavia</hi> from this Kingdom, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> being oppreſs'd by the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and reſtrain'd from their wonted Pyracies on the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> reſolv'd to ſhake off a Yoke which they could no longer bear, and by that means gave the <hi>Turks</hi> an opportunity to invade <hi>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Podolia,</hi> and the only place of ſtrength which the <hi>Polanders</hi> had upon that Frontier. That fatal War continued after the death of K. <hi>Michael,</hi> and diſturb'd the Reign of his Succeſſor <hi>John</hi> III, till the <hi>Polanders</hi> were at laſt conſtrain'd to make a Peace at <hi>Zurawno</hi> in <hi>Pokutia;</hi> for the Army of the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> was ſo numerous and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Year, that it conſiſted of above 180000 effective Men; and on the other hand that of the <hi>Polanders</hi> was ſo weak, that they could not bring above 12000 Men into the Field, becauſe they were depriv'd of the Aſſiſtance of a conſiderable part of the Forces of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> who were drawing together near <hi>Leopold,</hi> under Prince <hi>Michael</hi> of <hi>Radziwill,</hi> their General, but could not joyn the grand Army, becauſe the Infidels had block'd up all the Avenues to the Camp; ſo that the General was oblig'd to continue at <hi>Leopold,</hi> with the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63304:16"/>
                  <hi>de Bethune,</hi> and the L. <hi>Hide,</hi> Ambaſſador from the K. of <hi>England,</hi> expecting the iſſue either of a Peace, or of a Battel. Soon after a Peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with the <hi>Turks,</hi> of which the King imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſent an Account to Prince <hi>Michael</hi> of <hi>Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziwill,</hi> ordering him to communicate the News with all ſpeed to the Queen, who remained at <hi>Janowiecs,</hi> upon the <hi>Viſtula,</hi> over againſt <hi>Caſimir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By this Peace the <hi>Polanders</hi> yielded up <hi>Podolia</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> which is the beſt Country within the bounds of their <hi>Dominions;</hi> for the Earth is ſo fat and fertile, that they never dung it; and tho' they ſow it but once in two Years, it yields a plentiful Harveſt of Corn every Year. <hi>Aſparagus</hi> grows in the untill'd Fields, and the Foreſts are full of Trees, which bear excellent Fruit. And beſides, the loſs of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania</hi> is ſo much the more conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, becauſe it produces abundance of Salt-petre to make Powder, which the <hi>Polanders</hi> ſtand more in need of than any other Nation, becauſe their Country lies open on all ſides, and by conſequence is expoſed to the Incurſions of many Enemies. This is the laſt and the greateſt loſs that <hi>Poland</hi> has ſuſtained in its Wars with the Port; ſo that the Kingdom is now bounded on the Eaſt with <hi>Black Ruſſia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> have an irreconcilable Averſion to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> becauſe of the great difference of their Religions, which makes 'em look upon one another as Beaſts; the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> are no leſs Enemies to the Republic, by reaſon of the difference, or rather contrariety, both of their Inclinations and Religion; for all the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> are Schiſmatical <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Polanders</hi> are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally <hi>Roman-Catholicks.</hi> In the laſt War that was kind I'd betwixt theſe Nations, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> took from the <hi>Polanders,</hi> the Dutchies or Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates of <hi>Smolensko, Siberia,</hi> and <hi>Czernichowia,</hi> which
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63304:16"/>belong'd to <hi>Lithuania,</hi> beſides that of <hi>Kiowia,</hi> the poſleſſion of which was only granted to 'em by a Truce, and not by any Treaty of Peace; ſo that the <hi>Polanders</hi> may one day endeavour to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver theſe Provinces, but they are ſo far from being at preſent in a condition to make good their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, that they prolong the Truce with the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> from time to time.</p>
               <p>In the mean time if we conſider the management of the Wars and Differences betwixt theſe two Nations, it may be ſaid, that the <hi>Polanders,</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> are the ſame with the <hi>French,</hi> in regard to the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> for as the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> are not able to reſiſt the <hi>French</hi> in the Field, the <hi>Polanders</hi> have the ſame advantage over the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> when they are not intrenched, even tho' their Army be <hi>much more</hi> numerous. But on the other hand, as Nature has given the latter leſs Courage, ſhe has made 'em ſuperiour to the others in Subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Cunning. I might alledge ſeveral Inſtances to confirm and illuſtrate this truth, but I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my ſelf with obſerving, that in the year 1581, King <hi>Steven Battori</hi> had reduc'd the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> to ſuch a ſtraight, that they ſollicited him for a Peace, which not being able to obtain of that Prince up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Conditions they deſir'd, they entreated the Pope to intercede in their behalf: So true it is, that they are ready upon all occaſions to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Artifices, and leave no means unattem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted to accompliſh the Deſigns which they cannot execute by Force: For tho' (as I intimated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) they are all Schiſmatical <hi>Greeks,</hi> and do not acknowledge the Pope to be the Head of their Church, yet in their Neceſſity they ſcrupl'd not to implore his Aſſiſtance, and even gave him ſome Reaſon to hope that they might be prevail'd with to embrace the Catholick Faith. In the mean time the Pope gave ſo much Credit to their Inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63304:17"/>that he immediately diſpatch'd <hi>Anthony Poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and the Great Duke receiv'd him with ſo many Marks of a ſincere Affection, as if he had been really reſolv'd to become a Convert. But this was only an Artifice to amuſe the Pope, that by the interpoſition of the <hi>Nuncio,</hi> he might obtain either a Peace or a Truce; as he really did: For, notwithſtanding all the Advantages the King of <hi>Poland</hi> had over the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> he gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them a Truce for ten years, and reſtor'd all that he had taken from them; the Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> yielding up to him, at the ſame time, all that he poſſeſs'd in <hi>Livonia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it will not appear ſo ſurprizing, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> ſhould ſollicite the Mediation of the Pope, if we reflect upon the ſcandalous Methods they took to beg the Grand Signior's Aſſiſtance againſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> IV. King of <hi>Poland,</hi> during the War in which they were engag'd with that Prince, in the beginning of his Reign, <hi>Anno</hi> 1633.</p>
               <p>During my long abode in <hi>Lithuania,</hi> which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders upon <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> I was confirm'd in my former Opinion concerning the Artificial Conduct of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> by the many Inſtances which the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Country relate of the ungenerous Subtlety of their troubleſome Neighbors. I was aſſur'd, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> never invade <hi>Poland</hi> but when they ſee it engag'd in other Wars, and the Forces of the Kingdom employ'd elſewhere. The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had entertain'd an uninterrupted Peace with the <hi>Polanders,</hi> after the Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> IV. in the year 1634. by which they yielded up to him the Dutchies of <hi>Siberia</hi> and <hi>Czernichovia,</hi> with all the Land that lay within the ſpace of One hundred miles beyond thoſe Countries; yet, contrary to the expreſs Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of a Treaty, which ſeem'd to be ſo firmly eſtabliſh'd, as ſoon as they heard of the Irruption
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63304:17"/>of the <hi>Swedes</hi> into <hi>Poland,</hi> in 1655. they enter'd into <hi>Lithuania</hi> with an Army of 60000 Men, and took the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Vilna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But tho I have obſerv'd, that the Conduct of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> with reſpect to their Neighbors, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles that of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, that their Tempers and Characters are very different; for the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are civil and humane, and the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> on the other hand are generally rude and unpoliſh'd, and extreamly cruel; as it will appear by the following Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <p>King <hi>John Caſimir</hi> having concluded a Peace with the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> march'd into <hi>Lithuania</hi> with his whole Army, and retook the City of <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> the Metropolis of the great Dutchy; but the Caſtle made an obſtinate defence, becauſe the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covite</hi> who commanded in it was ſo cruel, that no man durſt talk of Surrendering. Nevertheleſs, this is not the moſt remarkable Inſtance of his Cruelty; for he order'd one of his Priſoners, who was a Prieſt, to be put into a great Mortar, and ſhot into the Air as a Bomb. However, the Caſtle was at laſt reduc'd, by means of ſome fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Officers, who finding themſelves preſs'd by the <hi>Polanders,</hi> and fearing that they ſhou'd have no Capitulation allow'd 'em, ſeiz'd the Governor, and put him into the hands of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> who caus'd his Head to be cut off, becauſe of his Cruelty to the Prieſt. And when they wanted a Hangman to perform the Execution, his own Cook offer'd to do it, with his Chopping-knife, adding, <hi>That he was glad of ſuch an Opportunity to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd, for the ill uſage he had receiv'd from him.</hi> Accordingly he cut off his Maſter's Head upon a Logg of Wood; as if it had been a piece of Beef, and was forc'd to give him ſeveral Slaſhes before he could entirely ſeparate his Head from his Body.</p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:63304:18"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen Battori</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> beſieg'd the City of <hi>Polotta</hi> in <hi>Muſcovy, Anno</hi> 1579. and after a moſt vigorous reſiſtance, the Beſieged finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unable to hold out longer, offer'd to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the place; the Capitulation was at laſt agreed upon, by the unanimous Conſent of the Garriſon and Inhabitants, except the Biſhop and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, who continually animated the Soldiers and the Burghers to make an obſtinate defence, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them, that it would be more honourable to dye in the Service of their Prince, than to ſave their Lives by an ignominious Treaty. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed neither the Biſhop nor the Governor would ſign the Capitulation, but retir'd into the Church of St. <hi>Sophia,</hi> whence <hi>Steven Battori</hi> caus'd them to be brought forth, and committed them to the Cuſtody of the Treaſurer of <hi>Lithuania.</hi> When the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Garriſon enter'd the Town, to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, and to receive the Stores and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions according to the Articles of the Capitulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they were ſurpriz'd to behold ſo many Marks of a horrible and brutiſh Cruelty, which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> had practis'd on the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Priſoners: they found ſome of 'em moſt barbarouſly torn in pieces, ſome half boil'd in great Kettles, with their Hands ty'd behind their Backs, and others who had been miſerably butcher'd by ripping up their Bellies: the <hi>Polanders</hi> were ſo tranſported with Rage and Indignation at the ſight of ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Scene of Horror, that they would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veng'd the death of their Countrymen upon the whole <hi>Muſcovitiſh</hi> Garriſon: But King <hi>Stephen</hi> ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly conſidering that no provocation could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the Breach of a ſolemn Treaty, reſtrain'd the Fury of his Souldiers, and ſent the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> back to their own Country, under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy of two Troops of Horſe. I could eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce many other Examples of this nature, but what
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63304:18"/>I have already ſaid is ſufficient to prove, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> are naturally cruel.</p>
               <p>I return now to that memorable Irruption which the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> made into <hi>Poland,</hi> with ſo much Violence and Succeſs, that King <hi>John Caſimir</hi> and his Queen <hi>Louiſe Mary</hi> were forc'd to leave the Kingdom, and to retire into <hi>Sileſia;</hi> for almoſt all the Nobility, and even the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, had abandon'd them, and follow'd the Rapidity of the Conqueror's Fortune. But the <hi>Polanders</hi> afterwards being ſenſible of the Fault they had committed in forſaking their King, and thoſe who had ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd faithful to him reſuming freſh Courage, under the Conduct of the General <hi>Czarneski,</hi> they by degrees expel'd the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who had made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of the whole Country, and of the City of <hi>Cracow,</hi> which they had taken in three days. Thus the Kingdom was reconquer'd, and the <hi>Swedes</hi> were oblig'd to enter into a Treaty of Peace, which was concluded in the Abby of <hi>Oliva.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Princes are ſo apt to be jealous of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conqueror, that they are even willing to aſſiſt a former Enemy againſt the unequal force of an ambitious and ſucceſsful Invader: For when the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> had made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Poland,</hi> at a time when the <hi>Polanders</hi> were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd in a War with the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieg'd <hi>Leopold,</hi> the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who had alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded <hi>Lithuania,,</hi> immediately quitted that Dut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and fell upon the <hi>Swedes</hi> in <hi>Livonia,</hi> in order to make a diverſion; and the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who are naturally Enemies to all <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nation, not only ſent a potent Army to aſſiſt the K. of <hi>Poland,</hi> but forc'd the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Leopold,</hi> and to joyn with them in the defence of the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi>

               <p>Nor are the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> the only troubleſome Neighbours to <hi>Poland,</hi> for 'twill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the following Relation, that the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of that Nation were in ſome meaſure owing to the <hi>Germans.</hi>

But ſince the Emperor deſign'd only to gain time, that the Knights might be able to put themſelves in a poſture of deſence, he was ſo far from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king care to adjuſt theſe Differences, that he was glad the <hi>Polanders</hi> were divided, fearing that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had driven the <hi>Teutonic</hi> Knights out of the Kingdom, they would make a vigorous Attempt to retake <hi>Sileſia,</hi> which the Kings of <hi>Bohemia</hi> had lately uſurp'd.</p>

               <p>This Harangue was applauded by the whole Senate, which ſo exaſperated <hi>Vitold,</hi> that he went out of the Aſſembly, after he had aſſur'd 'em, That ſince they did not think fit to comply with him, he would find ſome other way to compaſs his Deſigns.

                     </gap>na, Vitold</hi> pray'd him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to his Coronation, and not to envy him the Honour of wearing a Crown. To which the King anſwer'd, That he could not do it without the Conſent of the Lords of <hi>Poland,</hi> who had ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Cracow</hi> with him, that he might do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without his Approbation. Upon which <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told</hi> ſent ſome perſons to that Prelate to bribe his Fidelity, with Aſſurances of a magnificent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; adding in a flattering and obliging manner, That his Fortune depended upon him, and that he hop'd he would not prove the only Enemy to his Advancement.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who were intruſted with this Meſſage had Orders to tell the Biſhop, That he ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what an Affront it would be to their Maſter if he ſould not be crown'd King; That he deſir'd no more than that he would ſuffer him to wear the Crown for a moment, and that he would quit it immediately: At the ſame time they aſſur'd him, that if he continued obſtinately to oppoſe that Prince's Deſign, he would be his irreconcilable Enemy, and do every thing that lay in his power to diſpoſſeſs him of his Biſhoprick. But that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late reſolving to maintain the Honour and Intereſt of his Country, and being equally Proof againſt Promiſes and Threatnings, reply'd, That he was ſenſible their Maſter deſerv'd a Crown, but that he could not make himſelf Maſter of <hi>Lithuania</hi> without violating the Oath he had taken touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Union of that State with <hi>Poland,</hi> and therefore he advis'd him to lay aſide that pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſign, which would be ſo far from being ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honourable or advantageous to him, that it would be an eternal Reproach to him, and would haſten the Ruin of his Country: That he ſhould not flatter himſelf with thinking that the <hi>Germans</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:63304:23"/>and <hi>Teutonic</hi> Knights would be his faithful Allies, ſince they were irreconcilable Enemies both to the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> and <hi>Polanders:</hi> That their only deſign was to weaken both the one and the other, and of moſt firmly united Friends, as they were, to make them become mortal Enemies, that they might be able to execute their Deſigns upon thoſe two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and make 'em the Inſtruments of their own Ruin: That the King of the <hi>Romans</hi> could not forbear diſcovering his treacherous Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, declaring with a kind of Oſtentation, that He had caſt a Bone between two Dogs, that they might worry one-another. <hi>Vitold</hi> was ſo morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with this Anſwer, that his Grief threw him into a Fit of Sickneſs, and his Death, which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd ſoon after, broke the Meaſures which <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſmund</hi> had taken to diſunite <hi>Lithuania</hi> from <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have inſiſted the longer upon this Story, to ſhew, that after the <hi>Germans</hi> had taken <hi>Sileſia</hi> from the <hi>Polanders,</hi> they were ſtill forming new Projects to weaken 'em. And from hence we may alſo take notice of the terrible Conſequences of the miſtaken Politics of ſome Princes who intruſt their Subjects with too large a Share in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for 'tis plain, that by an exceſſive Kindneſs to his Uncle, this excellent King was in danger of loſing both <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the Peace concluded in the Abby of <hi>Oliva</hi> near <hi>Dantzick,</hi> the third of <hi>May,</hi> 1660, of which the <hi>French King</hi> was Guarantee, the <hi>Polanders</hi> yielded up <hi>Livonia</hi> to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of Ducal <hi>Pruſſia</hi> to the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg;</hi> and as for <hi>Sileſia,</hi> 'tis ſo long ſince they loſt it, that they think no more of recovering it, for it ſeems to be one of their peculiar Qualities to loſe the remembrance of their Loſſes.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Crim</hi> is divided into two parts, the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern and the Southern: the latter is cut thro the middle by very high and almoſt inacceſſible Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. The capital City of this <hi>Peninſula</hi> is <hi>Caffa,</hi> which is a conſiderable Port on the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> to the Eaſtward, which <hi>Mahomet</hi> the Emperor of the <hi>Turks</hi> took from the <hi>Genoeſe,</hi> in the year 1475. The whole <hi>Peninſula</hi> is but 78 leagues in length, and 40 in breadth. 'Tis border'd with the <hi>Palus Sukamorzi</hi> towards the North, the <hi>Black Sea</hi> on the South and Weſt, the <hi>Palus Maeotis</hi> and the <hi>Cimmerian Boſphorus,</hi> which ſeparates it from <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſia</hi> towards the Eaſt. It is joyn'd to the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent by a very narrow <hi>Iſthmus</hi> towards the North near the Town of <hi>Precop.</hi> After the year 1188, when the <hi>Tartars</hi> came into that <hi>Peninſula,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd under the Dominion of one Soveraign In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant from the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> But as Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among Princes is frequently the occaſion of their ruin, ſo the <hi>Crim</hi> became ſubject to the <hi>Turk</hi> by the Animoſities that happen'd betwixt two Brothers.</p>
               <p>For <hi>Machmetkirey,</hi> Chan of the <hi>Crim Tartars,</hi> the Ally and Friend of the <hi>Turks,</hi> had two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who revolted againſt him; but not being ſtrong enough to reſiſt him, they put themſelves under the protection of <hi>Stephen Battori</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and <hi>Machmetkirey,</hi> after he had ſeveral times in vain demanded them of that King, pray'd <hi>Amurath</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Turks</hi> to require 'em in his own name The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> comply'd with his Requeſt, and prevail'd with the King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to ſend 'em to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> with an Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63304:24"/>to aſſiſt at the Circumciſion of his Son. But when <hi>Amurath</hi> had thoſe two Princes in his power, inſtead of reſtoring them to <hi>Machmetkirey</hi> their Brother, he reſolv'd to retain them as Hoſtages for his Fidelity, and by that means to keep him in a perpetual dependance upon the Port.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Grand Signior</hi> being at that time engag'd in a War with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he deſir'd the Cham of <hi>Tartary</hi> to aſſiſt the <hi>Turks</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and upon that condition promis'd to deliver up his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Upon this Aſſurance <hi>Machmetkirey</hi> march'd ed from <hi>Tartary</hi> with a powerful Army, in order to aſſiſt him; but underſtanding, as he was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thro' <hi>Mingrelia,</hi> that the <hi>Turks</hi> were totally routed by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> he march'd back to his own Country, where he expected to find his Brothers; but perceiving that <hi>Amurath</hi> had diſappointed him, he was ſo enrag'd, that the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> was forc'd to appeaſe him with Preſents, and to ſend Ambaſſadors to make his excuſe for not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Promiſe, pretending, that he was afraid to ſend back the two Princes in his abſence, leſt they ſhould have rais'd ſome diſturbances, and aſſuring him, that he would put them very ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily into his hands. Not long after, theſe two Princes made their eſcapes from <hi>Conſtantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> and by the aſſiſtance of ſome other <hi>Tartars,</hi> and of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> rais'd a new War againſt their Brother, which oblig'd <hi>Machmetkirey</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Succours of <hi>Amurath,</hi> who promis'd to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him with ſome Troops, but ſent him none. In the mean time the Cham drove his Brothers out of the <hi>Peninſula,</hi> without the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s aſſiſtance, whom he ſuſpected to be the Contriver and Promoter of the Rebellion, concluding, that if he had not had ſuch a deſign, he would have deliver'd 'em up long before, or at leaſt would
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63304:25"/>have kept 'em ſo ſecure, that they could not have made their eſcape.</p>
               <p>At the ſome time <hi>Amurath,</hi> who was ſtill engag'd in the War with the <hi>Perſians,</hi> ſent to require <hi>Muchmetkirey</hi>'s Aſſiſtance, no longer as a Friend, but as a Maſter, and in a haughty and imperious manner; which ſo enrag'd the Cham, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to commit Hoſtilities againſt the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> without declaring War. He beſieg'd the City of <hi>Caffa,</hi> and preſs'd it ſo hard in a few days, that the <hi>Turks,</hi> who were not in a poſture of defence, becauſe they were not afraid of being attack'd by a Prince who was their Ally, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to ſurrender it in two days time, if they were not reliev'd. Then <hi>Amurath,</hi> who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly alarm'd at ſo unexpected an Expedition, ſont for one <hi>Aſſan</hi> a <hi>Tartar,</hi> whom he had kept a long time Priſoner, and who was ſaid to be the Baſtard-brother of <hi>Machmetkirey.</hi> He ſpoke to him in a very obliging manner, and told him, that if he would obey his Orders, he would advance him to great Honours; that the Cham of <hi>Tartary</hi> had declar'd War againſt him without any reaſon; that he was a Tyrant, and abus'd his Subjects ſo barbarouſly, that they were no longer able to bear his Cruelties; and that if he would undertake to invade <hi>Crim Tartary,</hi> he would furniſh him with Mony, and an Army to deliver his Countrymen from their inhuman Oppreſſor. <hi>Aſſan,</hi> who had never dreamt of exchanging his Chains for a Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, tranſported with Joy at the proſpect of ſo happy a turn in his Fortune, readily accepted <hi>Amurath</hi>'s Offer: He was declar'd Viceroy of <hi>Tartary,</hi> under the protection of the <hi>Grand Signior,</hi> to whom he took an Oath of Fidelity, and to all his Succeſſors in the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire; and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards having receiv'd the Golden Standard as a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:63304:25"/>Mark of his Inveſtiture, he departed from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> with 40 Galleys commanded by General <hi>Ochiali,</hi> and arriv'd in a few days at <hi>Caffa,</hi> juſt as that City was going to be ſurrender'd to <hi>Mach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metkirey.</hi>

               <p>After he had reliev'd <hi>Caffa,</hi> he endeavour'd by Preſents and Promiſes to gain the principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons among the <hi>Tartars</hi> to his ſide, and to induce them either to kill the Cham, or to deliver him up alive to him. He found it no difficult Task to debauch their Fidelity; for the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> had furniſh'd him with a great quantity of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and 'tis the general weakneſs of the Orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Nations, that they are very eaſily brib'd. Thus having ſecur'd a conſiderable number of them, and even ſome of the Chain's moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Friends, he caus'd him to be maſſacr'd, with his two Sons, after which he was acknowledg'd Cham of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and acquir'd the Eſteem and Affection of his Subjects by his extraordinary Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality to them. 'Twas thus that the <hi>Crim Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> who till then were a free People, became Vaſſals to their ancient Allies; and, by the way, this may ſerve to ſhew us what ſucceſs may be expected from an Alliance with the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> are naturally ſo barbarous and cruel, and of ſo haughty and imperious a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that they deſpiſe all thoſe who profeſs the Faith of Chriſt, and look upon them as Beaſts; ſo that when they obtain any Advantage over them, they impoſe inſupportable Conditions up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Thus the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who inhabit along the <hi>Volga,</hi> impos'd very ſhameful and diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Conditions upon the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> when they forc'd 'em to pay tribute to 'em, <hi>anno</hi> 1470. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had ravag'd <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and ſubdu'd part of the Country, they made a Peace with the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> upon theſe Conditions: That the Czar or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63304:26"/>Great Duke ſhould pay a yearly tribute to the <hi>Tartars,</hi> which he ſhould be oblig'd to ſend to them on Horſeback; that he ſhould go himſelf on foot, with all the Lords of his Court, to meet the perſon who ſhould come to demand the ſaid tribute, even tho it were but a Poſtillion or Groom; that the Czar ſhould, in a very reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner, preſent him with a Pot of Mares-Milk, to drink; that if any one drop of it ſhould happen to be ſpilt upon his Horſe's Mane, the Duke himſelf ſhould be oblig'd to lick it off with his Tongue; that he ſhould ſpread a fine Sable Furr under the Feet of him who ſhould read the Prince of <hi>Tartary</hi>'s Letters; that he and all the Lords of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> ſhould hear them read upon their Knees; and that they ſhould blindly obey all his Orders, even tho he ſhould command them to make War againſt the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Year 1226, in the Reign of <hi>Boleſlaus Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus,</hi> the <hi>Crim Tartars</hi> made a terrible Irruption into <hi>Poland,</hi> over-run all the Palatinate of <hi>Lublin.</hi> and having paſſed the <hi>Viſtula</hi> at <hi>Zavichoſt,</hi> rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Country, and carried away a great Booty into <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> After they had ſecur'd their Prey, they return'd to <hi>Poland,</hi> where they committed far greater Barbarities; and, as if the whole Kingdom had not been ſufficient to ſatisfie their inſatiable Deſire of Plunder, they march'd as far as <hi>Sileſia,</hi> where the Dukes of <hi>Oppelen, Ratibor,</hi> and <hi>Lignitz,</hi> having joyn'd the <hi>Teutonic</hi> Knights, and the Troops of <hi>Great Poland,</hi> reſolv'd to attack them, but were themſelves unfortunately defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the ſlaughter was ſo great, that the <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians</hi> carried away with 'em nine Sacks full of Ear-rings, which they had cut from the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> after the Battle.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:63304:26"/>
               <p>Some time after, in the ſame Reign, the <hi>Tartars</hi> return'd into <hi>Poland</hi> with a great Army, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Romanus</hi> Dukes of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> who tho' they profeſs'd the Chriſtian Faith, ſcrupl'd not to join with its mortal Enemies. After they had over-run the Palatinates of <hi>Lublin, Sandomir,</hi> and <hi>Cracow,</hi> they retir'd into their own Country: but the Dukes of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> being alſo deſirous to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves with Booty, made Incurſions into <hi>Maſſovia</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> where <hi>Boleſlaus</hi> defeated them; and <hi>Romanus</hi> was afterwards kill'd at <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vichoſt,</hi> a ſmall City on the <hi>Vistula,</hi> about two leagues below <hi>Sandomir.</hi> But, as if thoſe firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions which the <hi>Tartars</hi> made into <hi>Poland</hi> had only ſerv'd for a Whet to their ravenous Appetites, they return'd again in the Reign of <hi>Leſeus Niger,</hi> in the year 1279, with a terrible Army, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away ſo many Slaves, that having counted them at <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lodzimirs,</hi> a Town of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Volhinia,</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> they found that there were Twenty thouſand young Women among the Captives.</p>
               <p>I might venture to affirm, that the <hi>Tartars</hi> have invaded <hi>Poland</hi> in the Reigns of almoſt all its Kings. In that of <hi>John Albert</hi> they made an Irruption into <hi>Volhinia,</hi> in the year 1493. And in the ſame Reign, being joyn'd by the <hi>Turks,</hi> they made ſuch a dreadful Incurſion into that miſerable Country, that after they had ſacked <hi>Premiſlia, Jeroſlaw,</hi> and ſeveral other Cities, they carried away above One hundred thouſand perſons of all Ranks and Sexes into Slavery, ſo that <hi>Thracia, Scythia,</hi> and almoſt all <hi>Aſia,</hi> was fill'd with <hi>Poliſh</hi> Slaves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> are naturally ſo hardy, that they ſwim over the Rivers in the Winter when there is no Ice; which, without doubt, proceeds from the Mothers waſhing their Infants with cold Water. They croſs the great Rivers, ſuch as the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:63304:27"/>after this manner: each of them prepares ſeveral Faggots or Bundles of Ruſhes or Reeds, which he ties to two Poles; upon theſe he lays his Clothes, Arms, Saddle, and all that he intends to carry along with him; then he ties this little Bridge of Fagots to his Horſe's Tail, after which with one hand he takes hold of the Horſe's Main, and whips him with the other, and in this equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page paſſes the River ſtark naked.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Tartars</hi> take the Field, to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions, they agree beforehand, that when they are preſſed too hard by the Enemy, they ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide into ſeveral Parties, each of which ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire by a different way, and that they ſhall after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards rendezvous at a certain place. They take theſe Precautions, that thoſe who purſue them ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many tracts of Horſes feet, may not know which to follow.</p>
               <p>They are ſo afraid of being killed or taken Priſoners, that when they are preſs'd by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they fly with ſuch an amazing ſwiftneſs, that having tir'd one of their Horſes, they leap from him at a full gallop, upon the back of another, without diſmounting: and if they find that they are ſtill hotly purſu'd, they firſt throw away their Sabre then their Bow and their Arrows, and at laſt, without alighting from their Horſe, they cut the Girths, and drop the Saddle, and by that means eaſe their Horſes. If in their flight they meet with a Defile or narrow paſſage, they gallop thro' it with ſo much precipitation and diſorder, that they ride over one-another, without minding thoſe who command them; no, not the Cham, who is their Prince: which is an evident ſign that they are all extreamly apprehenſive of being kill'd or taken Priſoners.</p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:63304:27"/>
               <p>The Cham, who at preſent governs the <hi>Crim Tartars,</hi> is of the Family of <hi>Gilerey,</hi> and both he and all thoſe of his Race are cloath'd in Silk, the Officers in Cloth, and the reſt in Sheep-skins, with the woolly ſides next their skin in the Winter, but they turn 'em outwards in the Summer, or in rainy weather. They wear no Turbans, as the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> do, but Caps, like the <hi>Polanders:</hi> their Arms are a Sabre, with a Bow and Arrows; every one of them carries a Knife and an Awl, to make Whips and Straps, which ſerve to tye the Slaves, whom they take in their Incurſions: they are extreamly afraid of Fire-arms: their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtrength conſiſts in the ſwiftneſs of their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which are very ugly, but never tire; and each <hi>Tartar</hi> has many of them, which he leads along with him; and they know their Maſters ſo well, that they follow 'em when they fly, without loſing 'em, or running away from 'em.</p>
               <p>Their uſual Food is Horſe-fleſh, which they like ſo well, that they prefer it before Beef. I have ſeen ſome <hi>Tartars,</hi> who were Priſoners in <hi>Poland,</hi> eat Horſes that dy'd of any Diſtemper, and even devour the Head, Feet, and Intrails. None but the Rich eat Bread, and the reſt live upon Milk, Millet, and <hi>Turkey</hi> Wheat. They are very lazy when they are in their own Country, but are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly laborious and vigilant when they go abroad upon an <hi>Expedition.</hi> The Poor kill no Horſes to eat unleſs they be ſick; and when they kill one, they give part of it to their Neighbors: they make a ſort of Pudding with the Blood of the Horſe they kill and the Meal of <hi>Turkey</hi> Wheat or Millet, which they reckon to be a very delici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Ragou.</hi> They eat but little Salt, becauſe they believe it to be bad for the eyes; and ſince they are <hi>Mahometans,</hi> 'twould be needleſs to add, that they eat no Bacon. Theſe are ſome of the moſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63304:28"/>remarkable Obſervations I made during my abode in <hi>Crim Tartary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Tartars</hi> are divided into Hords or Cantons, almoſt like the <hi>Switzers.</hi> Theſe Hords are unequal in bigneſs, number, and ſtrength; the greateſt of them all is that betwixt <hi>Kilia</hi> and <hi>Bialogrod,</hi> which are two Towns, one at the mouth of the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> and the other at the mouth of the <hi>Danube.</hi> Next to this, the moſt conſiderable is that of <hi>Oczacow,</hi> a City and Fort, which the <hi>Turks</hi> call <hi>Dziareri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menda,</hi> at the mouth of the <hi>Boriſthenes:</hi> the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt of all the Hords is that of <hi>Kipozako,</hi> which takes its Name from the River that runs by the Town.</p>
               <p>The Cham of the <hi>Tartars</hi> never goes out of the <hi>Crim</hi> to take the Field, unleſs all the Hords march with him. There are alſo ſome <hi>Mahometan Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars</hi> ſubject to <hi>Poland,</hi> who live in <hi>Lithuania,</hi> near <hi>Vilna,</hi> where they poſſeſs Lands, and work as the other <hi>Lithuanians</hi> do; they were eſtabliſh'd there by <hi>Vitold,</hi> Uncle to King <hi>

Kiovia,</hi> ſcituated on the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> is the capital City, and was once one of the largeſt Towns in <hi>Europe;</hi> but it has been ſo often pillag'd and haraſs'd by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> that there is nothing to be ſeen in it, at preſent, but ruin'd Houſes and Cottages, with a Fort in which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> keep Garriſon. The <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> which is one of the greateſt Rivers in <hi>Europe,</hi> runs thro' the middle of the Country, and receives all the other Rivers that water it.</p>
               <p>The firſt Rendezvous of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who were originally <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Peaſants, was in the Iſles of the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> eſpecially that of <hi>Tamaho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Stephen Battori</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> was the firſt who brought the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> under Military Diſcipline, and appointed them the City of <hi>Trethymirow</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> about twelve leagues below <hi>Kiowia,</hi> for their place of rendezvous; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they had no Leaders, and were ſo far from obſerving Diſcipline, that they march'd rather like Freebooters than Soldiers. But from that time they began to make War againſt the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and gave them alſo occaſion to make frequent Inroads into <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the year 1614 the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> made ſuch great and ſucceſsful Incurſions as far as <hi>Aſia minor,</hi> that they took the City of <hi>Sinope</hi> upon the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> and ſtruck a Terror into <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> for they are ſo brave a People, that in the War betwixt <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III, and <hi>Oſman</hi> Emperor of the <hi>Turks, Anno</hi> 1620, four hundred of them, who came to ſerve in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, careleſly ſtraggling at a conſiderable diſtance from the reſt of their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, were attack'd by <hi>Oſman</hi>'s whole Army, with which they fought three days, and defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch incredible Valour, that the <hi>Turks</hi> loſt a vaſt number of Men before they could force 'em to ſubmit: And after they were beaten, the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, which was very formidable, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to hinder the other <hi>Coſſacks</hi> from joyning the <hi>Polanders,</hi> attack'd them in their paſſage; but after a Fight that laſted eight whole days, they joyn'd the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army in ſpite of all the Oppoſition of ſo numerous an Army; and, in a word, they did Wonders that Campaign. But after the Chriſtians had gain'd the Battel, they threaten'd to leave the Army, becauſe they want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bread; whereupon Prince <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus,</hi> who commanded the Army of the King his Father, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peas'd them with a Promiſe of Fifty thouſand <hi>Livres,</hi> which ſo encourag'd them, that they
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63304:29"/>ſtole ſecretly from the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, and attack'd and took the Baggage of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The chief reaſon why <hi>Oſman</hi> declar'd War againſt <hi>Poland,</hi> was, becauſe the <hi>Polanders</hi> did not reſtrain the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> from making Incurſions into his Dominions. 'Tis true, King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> was ſo unwilling to engage in a War with the <hi>Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior,</hi> that he did all that lay in his power to oblige the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to give over their Piracies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Black Sea.</hi> But as ſoon as they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves reſtrain'd from pillaging, they turn'd their Arms againſt the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> on the Frontiers of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> where they were totally routed by the Duke of <hi>Oſtrog;</hi> after which, under the Conduct of one <hi>Nalevaik,</hi> a man of mean birth, but of an intrepid fierceneſs, they invaded the Frontiers of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> a ſecond time, and march'd againſt the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> over whom they obtain'd ſome advantage in the beginning, but at laſt they were routed, and their Leader taken and carried Priſoner to <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,</hi> where he was beheaded. Thus it was in the Reign of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III, that the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to revolt; but this Sedition was ſo happily quieted, that afterwards they did very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervice in the War againſt the <hi>Turks, Anno</hi> 1620, as I intimated before.</p>
               <p>After the Peace was concluded between <hi>Poland</hi> and the Port, the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> not being able to give over their wonted Pyracies, embark'd on the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> in the year 1624, and went to the very Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> from whence they carried away a great booty.</p>
               <p>The next year they enter'd the <hi>Crim</hi> without King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s Leave, of which the Grand Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nior complain'd to the Republick, as an Infraction of the Treaty concluded with the Port: And from that time General <hi>Koniesſpolski</hi> began to reſtrain
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:63304:30"/>them from making Incurſions into the Territories of the <hi>Turks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> not being able to endure ſuch a Conſtraint, revolted a ſecond time in the Year 1630, at the ſollicitation of a Monk of <hi>Kiowia,</hi> and defeated ſome of King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s troops; but General <hi>Koniecſpolski</hi> ſurpriz'd them near <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſlaw,</hi> a little City in <hi>Lower Volhiniv,</hi> upon the River <hi>Trubiecz,</hi> about three leagues above the place where it falls into the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> and after he had defeated part of their Army, the reſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſend the Authors of the Revolt to the approaching Dyet.</p>

                  </hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed in the year 1638, which ſo enrag'd the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> that they took up Arms immediately under the Command of one <hi>Demetrius Timoſze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits;</hi> but they were quickly oblig'd to ſubmit, partly by Force, and partly by Promiſes.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:63304:30"/>
               <p>In the Winter they cover their Bodies with rough Sheeps-skins, and are ſo hardy, that they endure Hunger, Thirſt, Wind, Rain, Heat, Cold, and all the Injuries of the Weather with much leſs trouble than any other People. When they made Incurſions upon the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> they did not uſe Boats or Veſſels, like othe Pyrates, but the large hollow trunks of a certain Tree about ſixty foot long: Into each of theſe trunks they put fifty Men arm'd, not with Bows and Arrows like the <hi>Tartars,</hi> but with Muskets, with which they ſhoot ſo juſt, that they ſeldom miſs the Mark. When they embark'd upon any Expedition, they prohibited, under ſevere penalties, the taking in of any intoxicating Liquor, leſt Drunkenneſs ſhould enervate them, and ſo render them inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of putting their Deſigns in execution.</p>
               <p>When they encamp, they do not raiſe Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but place their Carts round 'em; and in the midſt of this Encloſure, which they call <hi>Tabor,</hi> they defend themſelves with an incredible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy. Their Troops are divided into Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Seven or Eight thouſand men each, ſo that they have very few Officers, in which they differ very much from other Nations, who are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally perſwaded that the ſtrength of an Army conſiſts in the multitude of Officers.</p>
               <p>One of the cauſes of their Revolt, was the change of Religion, which the Lords of <hi>Poland</hi> would have introduc'd into <hi>

For, the <hi>Polanders</hi> finding that they would not be prevail'd with to embrace the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Religion, had recourſe to violent methods, and ſo forc'd 'em to exchange their Cuſtoms, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Ceremonies, for thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to receive the Reformation of the Kalendar which was made by <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. But the <hi>Ruſſiant</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:63304:31"/>not being able to endure ſuch an Innovation, and diſdaining to bear the Yoke that was impos'd on 'em, the more they were preſs'd to ſubmit to it, the more vehemently they complain'd againſt and threaten'd thoſe who would have compel'd 'em to receive an Alteration to which they had ſo ſtrong and ſo natural an averſion. At laſt they reſolv'd to call in the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who were all of their own Religion. This Difference in Religion occaſion'd ſuch an implacable Animoſity betwixt the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> that they could never after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be reconcil'd. And this was one of the principal cauſes of the Revolt of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> and of all the Diſaſters with which <hi>Poland</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards haraſs'd.</p>
               <p>Such was the diſmal effect of that Change of Religion, and of thoſe Ceremonies which the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gentry would have introduc'd into their Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories in <hi>Ruſſia:</hi> they ought to have conſider'd, that the beſt Innovations are frequently attended with fatal Conſequences, and their own Country might have furniſh'd 'em with a very inſtructive Example of this nature. The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Doctrin was introduc'd into <hi>Riga</hi> by a Sedition of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſort of people, in the Year 1586, not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Reformation of the Kalendar made by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> XIII. had been publiſh'd there. Some perſons reſolving to celebrate the Feaſt of our Saviour's Nativity according to the ancient Kalendar, the Governor of the City impriſon'd the Principal of the College, becauſe he was the firſt who acted contrary to the Decree of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; which rais'd ſo great an Uproar in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the People in the night-time broke open the Priſon, and pull'd down the Houſes of the Curate and of the Governor: And even the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order was ſo great, that almoſt all the Inhabitants took up Arms againſt thoſe who defended the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Catholick</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:63304:31"/>Religion, and eſpecially the Jeſuits, whom King <hi>Stephen Battori</hi> had ſettl'd there in the year 1582, after he had given 'em certain Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues and a Church which belong'd to the Canons. During the heat of the tumult, the incens'd Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple impriſon'd ſome of the Senators, and put ſome others to death; ſo that being ſenſible of their Guilt, and deſpairing of Pardon, they put themſelves under the protection of other <hi>Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rans,</hi> and never afterwards return'd to their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Religion.</p>
               <p>Thus 'tis plain, that the reſtraining of the <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> from making Incurſions, and the Change of Religion which the Lords of <hi>Poland</hi> would have introduc'd into their Territories in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> were the two principal Cauſes of that Peoples revolt. But there was alſo another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that caus'd that fierce and untractable Nation to rebel.</p>
               <p>The Gentry of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Volhinia</hi> were ſo addicted to Tyranny and Oppreſſion, that they could not endure the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> becauſe their neighbourhood gave a bad Example to all their Subjects, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpos'd 'em to ſhake off the inſupportable Yoke of Servitude; for they thought it better to live, like the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> at Liberty, and without Conſtraint, than to work and till the Ground for the uſe of their Oppreſſors; ſo that the tyranny of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen augmented the number of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> by forcing the Peaſants to forſake their Habitations, and retire to them.</p>
               <p>The fourth reaſon that the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> had to complain of the Gentry, proceeded from the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Uſury and inſatiable Avarice of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who are very numerous in <hi>Poland,</hi> except in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Maſſovia.</hi> where they are only permitted to remain when there is a <hi>Dyet</hi> ſitting at <hi>Warſaw.</hi> They live miſerably thro the whole Kingdom,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63304:32"/>becauſe they are oppreſs'd and ſqueez'd by the Gentry; they are uſually the perſons who ſell <hi>Aqua-Vitae</hi> and Beer, and farm the Cuſtoms of the Lords, which they do for the moſt part at an exceſſive price; and this is the reaſon why they make bad Brandy and Beer. They were firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd into <hi>Poland</hi> by a Duke of <hi>Kaliſch,</hi> who brought them from <hi>Germany,</hi> and eſtabliſh'd them in his and ſome other Cities of <hi>Lower Poland,</hi> from whence they ſpread themſelves throughout the whole Kingdom: they have the Privilege not to acknowledge any Judge, but only the <hi>Palatins,</hi> whom they eaſily ſoften (not to ſay corrupt) by the Preſents they make them. Their Uſury and Exactions upon the People have ſometimes riſen to ſuch an exorbitant height, that they have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a Prohibition for any private perſon to brew Beer, not even for themſelves, by which means they oblig'd all the Inhabitants of the Kingdom to buy it of them at what price they pleas'd to impoſe upon it.</p>
               <p>The Son of King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> dying in the Year 1647, the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> began again to revolt, under the command of one <hi>Chemeinski,</hi> who was the firſt that made the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> joyn the <hi>Tartars,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the mortal Enmity that was formerly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 'em by reaſon of the great difference of their Language, Manners, and Religion. After they were thus united, in the Year 1648, they made a terrible havock in <hi>Poland.</hi> But before I proceed to relate their Barbarities, it will not be improper to give a ſhort Character of <hi>Chemelnski.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He underſtood War very well, and was once Secretary to the Army; he was alſo a man of Learning, and had ſtudied with the Jeſuits at <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold;</hi> he knew the weak ſide of the Court of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> having been ſeveral times there in the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an Envoy; he was ſo exaſperated by the loſs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63304:32"/>of an Eſtate which a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Lord had taken from him, by a Law-ſuit, that immediately he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to force; and having gather'd out of the Iſles of the <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> a multitude of People like himſelf, and corrupted the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, he ſoon after prevail'd with the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Tartars</hi> to joyn him, with whoſe aſſiſtance he fell unexpectedly upon the <hi>Polanders</hi> who guarded the Frontiers of the Kingdom, and afterwards cut in pieces part of their Army, and ſent the reſt, with their Commanders, into Slavery to <hi>Tartary.</hi> From that time he ſo manag'd the Republick, that ſometimes he ſuffer'd himſelf to be appeas'd by Promiſes, and then rais'd a new Inſurrection, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the poſture of his Affairs. 'Tis true, he was ſometimes beaten by the <hi>Polanders,</hi> but 'tis no leſs certain that he always kept the Advantage over 'em, either by his own dexterity, or by the Diviſions or Neglect of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Generals, who could not make a right uſe of their Victories. He was often reconcil'd to the Republick, but never truſted in them. He was naturally of a turbulent Spirit, keeping his Men always in Arms againſt <hi>Poland,</hi> and fortifying his Intereſt by the Affiance of ſome potent Neighbour; for 'twas his conſtant practice to change his Affies according to the ſtate of his Affairs. Thus, after the <hi>Tartars</hi> had concluded a Peace with King <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> he implor'd the Protection of the Duke of <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> ſo that <hi>Poland</hi> could hardly entertain any Hope of being able to reduce the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> during the life of ſo politick a General.</p>
               <p>After the death of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> IV, <hi>May</hi> 30, 1648, <hi>John Caſimir</hi> his Brother was choſen King of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Nov.</hi> 17, in the ſame Year. He immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apply'd himſelf to remedy the ill ſtate of the Republick, and to repair the Loſſes it had ſuſtain'd by the Irruption which the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:63304:33"/>had made even into the very Heart of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, after the Defeat at <hi>Pilaveze, Sept.</hi> 29, 1648. The greateſt part of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army was compos'd of new-rais'd Soldiers and of Militia; they were encamp'd near the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> end had even obtain'd ſome Advantages over them; but thoſe Revolters having made a great noiſe in the Evening with their Drums and Trumpets, and by diſcharging ſeveral Volleys of Canon round their Camp, the new-rais'd <hi>Polanders</hi> believ'd that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing for the arrival of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> whom they expected, which put 'em into ſuch a conſternation, that they reſolv'd upon a ſudden flight, their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers not being able to ſtop them. The diſorder was ſo great, and the flight ſo precipitate, that the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were for a whole day of opinion, that it was only a Feint to draw them from their Poſt; but at laſt having detach'd ſome Troops to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Enemy, they underſtood that there was not one Soldier left in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Camp; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they marched immediately, and pillag'd all the Baggage that the <hi>Polanders</hi> had left: And the <hi>Tartars</hi> arriving afterwards in their Army, they carried Terror and Deſolation into the very Heart of the Kingdom. Such was the fatal effect of a panick Fear that ſurpriz'd thoſe new-rais'd and undiſciplin'd Troops.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army being thus totally diſpers'd at <hi>Pilaveze,</hi> a ſmall City in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Volhinia,</hi> about two leagues from <hi>Chmielnich,</hi> on the River <hi>Bugg,</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Coſſacks</hi> beſieg'd <hi>Leopold</hi> with an Army of 300000 Men, and at the firſt Aſſault took the Caſtle, but they met with a more than ordinary reſiſtance from the Town, tho it was neither ſtrong by Nature nor Art, and defended by a ſmall Garriſon. When theſe <hi>Barbarians</hi> perceiv'd that they could not make themſelves Maſters of the City, they demanded 200000 Crowns of Gold
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63304:33"/>for its ranſom; and the Burghers not being able to pay ſo exorbitant a Sum, and fearing the Event of a Siege, gave them 1200 Marks of uncoin'd Silver, among which there was a great quantity of Church-plate; but they not being ſatisfy'd with ſo ſmall a ſum, continu'd to preſs the City which oblig'd the Burghers to give them 16000 Livres more, which they rais'd with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary difficulty; and beſides, they gave them the holy Ornaments, Cloth, Silks, and abundance of Furrs; for tho' the City wants the Convenience of a River, 'tis a place of great Trade, becauſe it is the Metropolis of all <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> Thus the <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> rais'd the Siege of <hi>Leopold, Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 24, 1648, after which they ravag'd the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and after the <hi>Tartars</hi> return'd home, the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> alone laid Siege to <hi>Zamoiſcia,</hi> a Town ſeated upon a Lake in the Palatinate of <hi>Belcz,</hi> fortified with ſeven Baſtions, and beautified with an Academy, which <hi>John Zamoski,</hi> Chancellor and General of the Army of the Crown, founded there. It is famous for the vigorous reſiſtance it made againſt <hi>Chemelnski,</hi> General of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who beſieg'd it with an Army of above 60000 Men, towards the end of the Year 1648.</p>
               <p>The Year following King <hi>John Caſimir</hi> ſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to <hi>Chemelnski,</hi> to endeavour to bring him to a ſenſe of his Duty, and in the mean time to entreat him to reſtrain the Violence of his Troops. and to hinder them from making Incurſions. But <hi>Chemelnski</hi> anſwer'd fiercely, <hi>That he would put himſelf under the Protection of the Port, if the</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers <hi>would not grant him all the Conditions he requir'd.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King, who was reſolv'd to leave no means unattempted to overcome the Obſtinacy of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> ſent other Deputies to treat with 'em con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Articles of Peace; they found <hi>Chemclnski</hi> at
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63304:34"/>
                  <hi>Pereaſlaw,</hi> where they deliver'd to him, in the King's Name, the Batoon of a General, on the 20th of <hi>February,</hi> 1649, and receiv'd his Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, which look'd rather like abſolute Commands than Conditions of Peace; for he exclaim'd with great vehemency againſt <hi>Viſnovieshi</hi> and <hi>Czaplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski,</hi> and declar'd with an infupportable Inſolence, <hi>That he would never be at quiet till he had chaſtiz'd them for all the Injuries they had done to the</hi> Coſſacks. <hi>That</hi> Viſnovieski <hi>muſt be puniſh'd, and</hi> Czaplinski <hi>put into their hands, as the Authors of all theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſters: That</hi> Potoski <hi>was not free from the Crime of having perſecuted the</hi> Coſſacks, <hi>even into the Iſles of the</hi> Boriſthenes, <hi>whither they had retir'd to ſave their Lives: That nevertheleſs</hi> Potoski (who was then a Slave in the <hi>Crim</hi>) <hi>was puniſh'd ſufficiently for all his pernicious Deſigns: That to thoſe three he might add the great Standard bearer of the Crown, who had robb'd him of his Inheritance, and had quarter'd his Troops in the Territories of the</hi> Coſſacks, <hi>where they committed all manner of Barbarities; but that he did not impute all thoſe Diſorders ſo much to him as to</hi> Viſnovieski <hi>and</hi> Czaplinski: <hi>That therefore the Puniſhment, as well as the Blame, ought to fall upon thoſe two; and that if they were not puniſh'd, he would periſh, with all the Army of the</hi> Coſſacks, <hi>or</hi> Poland <hi>itſelf ſhould periſh, with its Senate, Generals, Lords, and all the Nobility.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>King <hi>Caſimir</hi> perceiving the Deſign of the <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,</hi> by this Anſwer, drew his Forces together; and on the other hand <hi>Chemelnski</hi> call'd in the <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> who came to his aſſiſtance with a formidable Army, and attack'd a body of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Troops which was encamp'd at <hi>Zbaras,</hi> a ſmall City of <hi>Lower Podolia,</hi> upon the Frontiers of <hi>Lower Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinia,</hi> about ten leagues from <hi>Braclaw,</hi> towards the North, famous for the brave defence that a ſmall number of <hi>Polanders</hi> made againſt an infinite
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63304:34"/>number of <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> who kept them inveſted for two months, and thrice attack'd their Retrenchments, without being able to force them; for the <hi>Polanders</hi> defended themſelves with ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible a Valour, that they gave their King time to come to their relief. The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> hearing of their approach, march'd ſecretly to <hi>Zborow,</hi> on the River <hi>Bog,</hi> to meet him, where being defeated by King <hi>Caſimir,</hi> and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that another Party of <hi>Coſſacks</hi> was routed by the <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> they concluded a Peace with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was afterwards ratified in the Dyet held at <hi>Warſaw</hi> in the ſame Year 1649.</p>
               <p>After the Peace was concluded with the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> at <hi>Zborow, Chemelnski</hi> their General growing dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more powerful and inſolent, aſſiſted the Cham of <hi>Tartary</hi> againſt the <hi>Circaſſians,</hi> without the King's Leave; and afterwards having receiv'd Succours from the Cham, he attack'd the Hoſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar of <hi>Moldavia,</hi> from whom he exacted a great Ranſom, with a Promiſe to give his Daughter in Marriage to his Son <hi>Timothy.</hi> But not being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with ſo conſiderable an Alliance, he ſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, <hi>Anno</hi> 1650, to the Port to deſire ſome Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary Forces, and to put himſelf under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Turks.</hi> Thus he ſhook off the Yoke of the Republic of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> made themſelves Maſters of all <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania;</hi> which was an extraordinary mortification to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility, who had juſt re-enter'd upon the Eſtates they had loſt during the Inſurrection of thoſe Rebels.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Caſimir</hi> having loſt all Hopes of reducing them by Promiſes or Favours, reſolv'd once more to have recourſe to Force. In purſuance of this Reſolution, he ſummon'd the Arrierban, in the Year 1651, and led them, with his whole Army, into the Fields which depends upon the City of <hi>Leſinow,</hi> beyond <hi>Beretesko,</hi> a City of the Palatinate
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:63304:35"/>of <hi>Luceoria,</hi> on the River <hi>Ster,</hi> about a league from the Frontiers of <hi>Ruſſia.</hi> In this place he found the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> joyn'd together, whom he attack'd and fought for three days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, during which time the Battel was very obſtinate on both ſides, but at laſt the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my obtain'd an entire Victory over the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and put <hi>Chemelnski</hi> and the Cham, who commanded in perſon, to flight. This de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat oblig'd <hi>Chemelnski</hi> to make a Peace with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which was concluded <hi>Sept.</hi> 28. 1651, but laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not long; for, ſoon after, the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> being enrag'd by the Inſolency of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility, and fearing to fall again into their ancient Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, attack'd the Army of the Republic, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally routed it.</p>
               <p>I obſerv'd, before that <hi>Chemelnski</hi> had always the Policy to enter into an Alliance with ſuch Princes who were beſt able to ſupport him. In purſuance of this Maxim, as ſoon as he underſtood that the <hi>Tartars</hi> had made a Peace with <hi>Poland,</hi> not daring to rely upon his own ſingle ſtrength, he put himſelf under the protection of the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcovites,</hi> in the year 1654, and made a League with 'em; which coſt the <hi>Polanders</hi> the City of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> which the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> took the ſame year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chemelnski</hi> dying <hi>Anno</hi> 1658, the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> choſe one <hi>Vihowski</hi> for their General, and threaten'd, that they would put themſelves into the hands of the <hi>Turk</hi> or the D. of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> if the Republic would not grant all that they demanded; upon which King <hi>John Caſimir</hi> conſidering that it would be equally diſadvantageous to his Kingdom, whether they ſubmitted to the Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> or the <hi>Turks,</hi> concluded a Peace with 'em, by which it was agreed, that all their Captains ſhould be Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>Poland;</hi> That <hi>Vihowski</hi> their General
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63304:35"/>ſhould be Palatin of <hi>Kiowia;</hi> That the Biſhops of the <hi>Greek</hi> Religion ſhould be admitted to the chief Offices; and, That the Metropolitan of <hi>Kiowia</hi> ſhould have the rank of a Senator. Beſides, the Staroſtie of <hi>Lubomliana</hi> was given to <hi>Vihowski,</hi> and that of <hi>Bobrois</hi> to <hi>Nieczaio,</hi> on condition that they ſhould hold them as Fiefs of the Republic. Theſe Conditions was afterwards ratified by the Diet: And by this means the <hi>Coſſack</hi> Captains, from miſerable Peaſants of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> as they were by their Birth, were advanc'd to the Dignity of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Noblemen.</p>
               <p>I have already obſerv'd, that the revolt of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> was partly occaſion'd by the Tyranny of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen; for they were their Lords, and had power of Life and Death over 'em, as they have ſtill in <hi>Poland</hi> over all their Peaſants. Thoſe of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania</hi> not being able to ſupport their Inſolency, began to revolt, and by degrees ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel'd all the Nobility. There were ſeveral great Lords, who by this revolution loſt above 100000 Crowns a Year, among whom was the above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Prince <hi>Viſnovieski,</hi> whoſe Son I have ſeen in <hi>Poland</hi> ſo poor, that he had only a yearly Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Six thouſand Livres, which Queen <hi>Mary Louiſe</hi> allow'd him to ſubſiſt upon; but Fortune afterwards rais'd him to the Throne, upon the abdication of King <hi>Caſimir;</hi> as I ſhall have occaſion to obſerve in its proper place.</p>
               <p>That fatal Revolt of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> which began in the Reign of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III, augmenting by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees under the following Kings, not only depriv'd many <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen of their Eſtates, and gave the <hi>Tartars</hi> occaſion to carry away above a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of perſons into Slavery, but was alſo the cauſe of the decay of the Chriſtian Religion throughout <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania:</hi> For it may be reaſonably ſuppos'd that the <hi>Turks</hi> endeavour to ſettle <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> in that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63304:36"/>Country, in imitation of all Conquerors, who the Letter to ſecure the Fidelity of the people whom they ſubdue, force them to receive their Religion, as the moſt effectual way to keep 'em in Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their new Maſters. And even tho' the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould not endeavour to ſettle <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> in all their Conqueſts, it wou'd at laſt become the modiſh Religion, ſince 'tis uſual for people to take the Language and Religion of a Prince, whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour they are deſirous to procure.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> having under ſeveral Generals maintain'd a War againſt the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually labour'd to reduce them, they were at laſt oblig'd to call in the <hi>Turks,</hi> and to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under their protection. Thus were thoſe Infidels admitted into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> and eaſily made themſelves Maſters of the City of <hi>Caminiec,</hi> which they found deſtitute of all ſorts of Proviſions; nevertheleſs they took it by Capitulation: But they were ſo far from obſerving the Articles they had granted, by which the Inhabitants were to continue ſtill in the profeſſion of their ancient Religion, that as ſoon as they were Maſters of the place, they carried away into Slavery all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that unhappy City, and left no mark of its having been once inhabited by Chriſtians, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Cathedral Church, which they have alſo turn'd to a Moſque. Theſe are the fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the inſupportable Tyranny of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of <hi>Poland,</hi> and of their unjuſtifiable Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to their Subjects.</p>
               <p>But long before the <hi>Turks</hi> invaded <hi>Poland,</hi> they look'd upon <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania</hi> as a Country which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to conquer at any rate, and which they might eaſily ſubdue, if the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> ſhould be oblig'd to deſire their protection. Beſides, they were willing to take hold of ſo favourable an Opportunity to deliver themſelves from ſuch
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:63304:36"/>cruel and formidable Enemies, who had ſo often haraſs'd 'em by their Pyracies on the <hi>Black Sea.</hi> They had made Peace with the Emperor, and conſequently were not oblig'd to keep an Army in <hi>Hungary;</hi> and after the abdication of King <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> who was a valiant Prince, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had choſen a peaceable King in his place: They conſider'd alſo, that the Revolt of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> gave them a free paſſage into a pleaſant and fertile Country, ſuch as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania</hi> certainly is, and invited 'em to make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Caminiec,</hi> which is the Key of that Province.</p>
               <p>For that City, which is the Metropolis of Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Podolia,</hi> is fortified by Nature, being ſituated on a Rock, environ'd by a very deep, broad, and ſleep Ditch, which is ſill'd with Water by the River <hi>Smotrzy</hi> which almoſt quite ſurrounds the City, ſo that it leaves only a narrow paſſage into it; and 'tis that entry only which is forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Art, all the reſt being ſufficiently defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Nature. Nevertheleſs it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, that the Hills that are beyond the Ditch being higher than the City, the Garriſon in a Siege might be very much incommoded with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery: But 'tis not ſuch an Inconveniency as this that can oblige a place of ſtrength to ſurrender, nor will it ever be reduc'd by ſo diſtant an attack; and, after all, the City of <hi>Caminiec</hi> will ne'r be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by the <hi>Polanders,</hi> unleſs the Port be one day reduc'd as low as <hi>Poland</hi> was when the <hi>Turks</hi> took it.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Michael</hi> the <hi>Polanders</hi> were ſo firmly perſwaded of the impoſſibility of reducing that place, and of the difficulty of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an end to the War with the Grand Signior, that they made a ſhameful Peace with him, and oblig'd themſelves to pay him a yearly Tribute. But the Dyet, which was afterwards held at <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,</hi>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:63304:37"/>would not ratifie that Peace; ſo that the War between <hi>Poland</hi> and the Port was renew'd with greater Vigor than before.</p>
               <p>The two Armies of the Crown and of the Dutchy advanc'd towards <hi>Podolia,</hi> the one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by General <hi>Sobieski,</hi> and the other by General <hi>Patz,</hi> and march'd together to attack that of the <hi>Turks,</hi> which was encamp'd at <hi>Chot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin</hi> on the <hi>Nieſter,</hi> about five leagues from <hi>Cami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niec,</hi> where they fought and entirely routed 'em. This Victory, which was very conſiderable, would have doubtleſs reſtor'd the Affairs of <hi>Poland</hi> to a good condition, and contributed very much to the retaking of <hi>Caminiec,</hi> if the Generals had made a right uſe of ſo important an Advantage. But the Battel was no ſooner over than they carried home their Troops, the one into <hi>Poland,</hi> and the other into <hi>Lithuania;</hi> in which they imitated their Predeceſſors <hi>Swir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>zowski</hi> and <hi>Oſtrogski,</hi> who after they had obtain'd a memorable Victory over the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> return'd home, inſtead of marching to attack <hi>Smolensko,</hi> which they had loſt a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and might then have eaſily retaken.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Error</hi> which thoſe two Generals commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by neglecting ſo inviting an opportunity to reduce <hi>Smolensko,</hi> was ſo unaccountable, and ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the Maxims of Policy, and even of common Prudence, that I cannot forbear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting the whole Story.</p>
               <p>In the year 1512, <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> married the Daughter of the Count of <hi>Scepuſz,</hi> which ſo incens'd the Emperor <hi>Maximilian,</hi> that he left no means unattempted to involve <hi>Poland</hi> either in a civil or foreign War. It was in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this deſign that in a Dyet of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Germany</hi> he complain'd of King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s Proceedings, alledging, That he was contriving indirect Methods to expel the <hi>Teutonic</hi> Knights
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:63304:37"/>out of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> which they had purchas'd with their Blood, and where they had extirpated Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm, and eſtabliſh'd the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt. But ſeeing he could not prevail with the Princes to declare War againſt the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> at a time when all the Chriſtians were ready to enter in a Confederacy againſt the <hi>Turks,</hi> he made a League with <hi>Baſil</hi> Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> and perſwaded him to declare War againſt the <hi>Polaenders,</hi> and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade <hi>Lithuania.</hi> The <hi>Muſcovite,</hi> relying upon this new Alliance with the Emperor, ſcrupl'd not to violate the Peace he had made with King <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund.</hi> He rais'd an Army, enter'd <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and after he had deſtroy'd the Country, ſate down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Smolensko,</hi> but could not take it; tho at the ſame time <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> was in <hi>Poland,</hi> and had no Troops on foot to oppoſe him.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> being inform'd of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of the Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> who had broke the Peace without any cauſe, call'd a Dyet at <hi>Radom,</hi> in the Year 1513, to concert the Meaſures that were to be taken in ſo preſſing an exigency. The Czar on the other hand ſent to demand Succours from the Emperor his Ally, who only ſent him ſome <hi>Engineers,</hi> who caſt 300 pieces of Cannon for him. The year following, the Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> having aſſembl'd an Army of 80000 Men, march'd with his 300 pieces of Cannon to beſiege <hi>Smolenske,</hi> which he batter'd in a very furious manner. The City was ſo cloſely block'd up, and the Avenues ſo well guarded, that 500 Horſe, whom the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſent to its relief, could not get into the place. In the mean time the Garriſon made ſo vigorous a defence, that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd by the obſtinate reſiſtance of the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> rais'd the Siege, and ravag'd <hi>Lithuania</hi> a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time. After they had ſent their Booty to <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> they return'd to the Siege of <hi>Smolensko,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:63304:38"/>but the Garriſon defended the place with ſo much Courage and Reſolution, that the Czar deſpairing of Succeſs, reſolv'd to raiſe the Siege; but <hi>Glinski</hi> a <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Rebel perſwaded him to continue it, inſinuating, that he could not without expoſing himſelf to eternal Infamy ſuffer an impotent and diſhearten'd enemy to inſult over ſuch a formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Army. At laſt the cunning Traytor, who had engag'd <hi>Baſil</hi> in this enterpriſe, perceiving that he could not take the City by force, reſolv'd to try the Succeſs of a Stratagem: To this end he deſir'd leave to ſpeak with the Governor, to whom he repreſented, That his Maſter was not in a condition to relieve him; that the Garriſon could not hold out much longer, and that unleſs he was reſolv'd to bury himſelf in the Ruins of the City, he ought to conſult his own true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and accept the vaſt Recompences which the Czar was willing to give him. Thus the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor was perſwaded to ſurrender the City of <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko,</hi> which the <hi>Polanders</hi> had poſſeſs'd for the ſpace of a hundred years.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> had receiv'd at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> the news of the loſs of that important place, he went immediately to <hi>Lithuania,</hi> in <hi>September,</hi> and aſſembl'd all the great Lords of that Dutchy at <hi>Vilna,</hi> to deliberate with them how they might effectually oppoſe the Progreſs of their victorious enemy; 10000 Horſe, 20000 Foot, and ſome light Horſe, were rais'd in <hi>Lithuania,</hi> with which, and with the Army of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the neceſſary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, the King ſet out from <hi>Vilna,</hi> with a deſign to attack the <hi>Muſcevites.</hi> The Czar having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd Advice of the march of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, reaſſembl'd his Troops, and encamp'd near <hi>Smo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lensko,</hi> leſt the King ſhould ſit down before it. After he had reinforc'd the Garriſon, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his Army to <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and advanc'd
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63304:38"/>to the River <hi>Berezina,</hi> in the Palatinate of <hi>Minsk;</hi> where <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> arriving immediately after, ſtruck ſuch a Terror into the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tir'd to the City of <hi>Orſza,</hi> not far from the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſthenes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> having paſſed the River <hi>Berezina,</hi> without any oppoſition, detach'd a body of 30000 choſen Men, whom he order'd to march towards the enemy, while he remain'd at <hi>Boryſſow</hi> on the River <hi>Berezina,</hi> with the reſt of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; where he caſt up Trenches and fortified the Camp with great diligence, that if the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> ſhould gain the Battle, the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuanians</hi> might have the advantage of retiring to a place of ſecurity; and that he might after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be in a condition to oppoſe the enemy, who even after a Victory would have been weaken'd by the Battle, and haraſs'd by the Fatigues of ſo long a purſuit.</p>
               <p>The Czar, who was at the head of an Army of 80000 Men, deſpis'd that of <hi>Poland,</hi> which was not half ſo numerous, and inſolently boaſted, that his Soldiers ſhould not ſo much as take the pains to draw their Sabres againſt the <hi>Polanders,</hi> but drive 'em all to <hi>Muſcovy</hi> with Whips, like Herds of Oxen, or Flocks of Sheep. Nor was this a meer <hi>Rhodomontade,</hi> for he actually gave Orders to his Soldiers, that they ſhould not draw their Sabres, but let the <hi>Polanders</hi> paſs the <hi>Bariſthenes</hi> without oppoſition, and then whip 'em to <hi>Muſcovy.</hi> But that inſolent and haughty Prince had the Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to be convinc'd by a very fatal and unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come experiment, that a great Army ſhould never deſpiſe a feeble Enemy, and that a Conqueror may quickly ruin himſelf by neglecting the prudent Maxims of a cautious Policy.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:63304:39"/>
               <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army arriv'd near the City of <hi>Orſza,</hi> the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> retir'd about 4000 paces beyond the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> concluding that their retreat would embolden the <hi>Polanders</hi> to paſs the River, and that afterwards they might eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat them, and intercept their flight. The Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> was then at <hi>Smolensko,</hi> about thirteen leagues from his Army, where he employ'd his time in dividing <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and ſharing it among his Generals, allotting to each of them a part of the Country on the Mapp, and conſidering how he ſhould diſpoſe of an Army whom he look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on already as his Priſoners. But the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who have always the advantage over the <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> in the open Field, were ſo incens'd at the Pride and Inſolency of the Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> who threaten'd to whip them, that they reſolv'd to give him Battle. In purſuance of this Reſolution they divided their Army into two parts, one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by General <hi>Suirczowski,</hi> and the other by General <hi>Oſtrogski.</hi> The two Generals having held a Council of War, commanded a Bridge to be laid over the River, and order'd all the Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, with the Infantry, to paſs the ſame; which being done, the Cavalry follow'd 'em with an incredible bravery; the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> purſuant to the Czar's Order, not ſtirring from their Poſts. The two Armies being drawn up in order of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>Suirczowski</hi> detach'd 800 Horſe for a body of reſerve, and order'd them to poſt themſelves in a Wood at the ſide of the Enemy's Army, and in the heat of the Fight to ſally out and attack the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> with terrible Cries, to put 'em in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a conſternation.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi>'s Army was ſo diſpos'd, that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Cavalry had the right Wing, and the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> the left, the Infantry being plac'd in the middle. The Battle began about three a
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63304:39"/>clock, the <hi>Polanders</hi> firſt attacking the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> with an undaunted Reſolution: Sometimes they gain'd Ground of 'em, and ſometimes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puls'd by the unequal numbers of their Enemies; but immediately they rally'd, and broke through 'em afreſh.</p>
               <p>On the other hand <hi>Oſtrogski,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> attack'd the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fury, and made a great ſlaughter among them. There was in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Camp a little ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Ground, which contributed very much to the gaining of the Battle, for their Artillery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planted there, made ſuch a dreadful havock in the Enemy's Rear, and broke all their Ranks in ſo terrible a manner, that they began to be diſorder'd, and to take the flight; and thoſe who were in the middle perceiving that thoſe who were in the rear gave way, began alſo to fly, while they were ſtill ſighting in the van. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this diſorder, the 800 Horſe who were poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Wood attack'd the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> in the flank with ſo much Fury, that being no longer able to ſuſtain the ſhock of the <hi>Polanders,</hi> the whole Army gave ground and fled.</p>
               <p>In this Battle 32000 <hi>Muſcovites</hi> were kill'd, and many drown'd in a Moraſs, which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to paſs in their flight. Some affirm, the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> loſt 40000 Men; and 'tis certain the ſlaughter was ſo great, that the Waters of the <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> grew red with the Blood that was ſned on its banks. The <hi>Polanders</hi> took a great number of Priſoners, and among others ten Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of the greateſt Lords of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Palatins or Governors of Provinces, and two thouſand Gentlemen. Of the <hi>Polanders</hi> there were but 400 men kill'd, but the number of the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was much greater. They obtain'd this memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Victory <hi>March</hi> 25. 1614.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:63304:40"/>
               <p>After the gaining of ſuch an important Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the loſs of which would have been infallibly attended with the total ruin not only of <hi>Lithu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ania,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Generals ought to have beſieg'd the City of <hi>Smolensko,</hi> which they might have eaſily retaken during the univerſal conſternation that was ſpread over <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> but inſtead of making a right uſe of that advantage, they retir'd without making any further attempt; and King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> himſelf, who expected the event at <hi>Boryſſow,</hi> return'd to <hi>Vilna</hi> with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, whom he caus'd to be led before him in a kind of Triumph. From thence he ſent Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to all Chriſtian Princes, to notifie the great Victory which he had obtain'd over the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> and that their Eyes, as well as Ears, might convince 'em of the Truth of that Advice, the Envoys were accompanied with fourteen <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> who were remarkable for their white Hair. But the Emperor being enrag'd at the loſs which his Allies had ſuſtain'd, and at the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py event of a War, of which he himſelf was the Author, ſurpriz'd the Envoys of the King of <hi>Poland</hi> as they were paſſing thro' his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, and took their Priſoners from 'em, whom he ſent back to the Czar, by the way of <hi>Lubec.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is ſo natural to the <hi>Polanders</hi> to neglect the advantages which they obtain over their Enemies, that after they had defeated <hi>Guſtavus</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in a memorable Battle, in which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was wounded, and could hardly ſecure his own perſon, they were ſo far from purſuing him, that they ſuffer'd him to retire to <hi>Stum,</hi> between <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienburg</hi> and <hi>Marienwerder,</hi> where having rally'd his ſcatter'd Forces, he renew'd the War with greater Vigor than before. Nor were they guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a leſs inexcuſable blunder after the Victory they obtain'd in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania, June</hi> 30. 1651; for tho
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63304:40"/>the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> were totally routed, and the Cham, with <hi>Chemelnski,</hi> put to flight, the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> retir'd, as if they had been beaten, and immediately concluded a Peace, by which they ſuffer'd the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to keep an Army of 20000 Men in the Palatinate of <hi>Kiowia.</hi> This Reflexion is ſo juſt and important, that I cannot forbear adding another remarkable inſtance of the ſame nature, which happen'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1489.</p>
               <p>About that time <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Podolia</hi> were miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably haraſs'd by the <hi>Tartars,</hi> who infeſted theſe Provinces with continual Inroads, and always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd home with a multitude of Slaves; at laſt King <hi>Caſimir</hi> reſolving to prevent the utter ruin of the Country, upon advice that the <hi>Tartars</hi> were preparing to make a new Incurſion into <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Podolia,</hi> he ſent <hi>John Albert</hi> his Son with a body of light Horſe to oppoſe 'em, and order'd all the Gentry of <hi>Ruſſia</hi> and <hi>Podolia</hi> to joyn him. The <hi>Tartars</hi> being divided into two bodies, the firſt of which conſiſted of 15000 Horſe, and the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of 10000, were returning home, without fearing any danger, with a prodigious number of Slaves, according to their uſual Cuſtom; but the young Prince with his Troops meeting the firſt, attack'd and totally routed them, and took from them all the Booty and Slaves they had carried away. After this Succeſs, he march'd immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to attack the other body: The Officer who commanded 'em made ſome reſiſtance, but was at laſt kill'd, and the ſlaughter was ſo great, that the <hi>Polanders</hi> were weary with cutting off ſo many Heads, for not one of the <hi>Tartars</hi> return'd to the <hi>Crim.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This total defeat of the <hi>Tartars</hi> ought to have encourag'd the <hi>Polanders</hi> to purſue their Victory, and in their return to enter the <hi>Crim,</hi> and ravage all they could, which they might have done the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63304:41"/>more eaſily, becauſe <hi>Poland</hi> reach'd at that time to the <hi>Black Sea,</hi> and becauſe they might have ſurpriz'd that Peninſula, ſince there was not one <hi>Tartar</hi> that eſcap'd to carry the News of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, or of the march of the <hi>Polanders.</hi> But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of taking this favourable Opportunity to invade, or at leaſt alarm, theſe <hi>Barbarians,</hi> with whom they were ſenſible they could never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a ſolid and durable Peace, Prince <hi>John Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> return'd to <hi>Poland</hi> in triumph, and the King his Father receiv'd him with a great deal of Joy, inſtead of checking him for not purſuing his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; and all the <hi>Polanders</hi> extoll'd his Courage and Prudence. This then is the uſual Conduct of the <hi>Polanders,</hi> after the gaining of a Battle.</p>
               <p>I obſerv'd, that the <hi>Polanders</hi> know by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that they can never make a ſolid peace with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> or rely upon their promiſes; and I could eaſily prove this Remark by above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred examples, but I ſhall content my ſelf with mentioning two of theſe Inſtances. <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> preparing to make War with the Duke of <hi>Muſcovy</hi> in the year 1516, and being deſirous to ſecure <hi>Podolia</hi> and <hi>Volhinia,</hi> gave a ſum of Mony to <hi>Mendlinges</hi> Cham of <hi>Tartary,</hi> that he might not only oblige him to make no Irruptions into <hi>Poland,</hi> but alſo to make a powerful diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in <hi>Muſcovy;</hi> which the Cham promis'd and ſwore to do: but he had no ſooner receiv'd the Mony from the <hi>Polanders,</hi> than he violated his Oath; for marching out of the <hi>Crim</hi> with 300000 Horſe, inſtead of invading the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd into <hi>Podolia</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> and encamp'd at <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceoria,</hi> from whence he ſent four of his principal Officers, each with a great body of Horſe, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only the fourth part of his Army with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who made ſuch a terrible havock thro' the whole Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> and eſpecially in the
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63304:41"/>Palatinates of <hi>Belcz, Leopold,</hi> and <hi>Lublin;</hi> and the Conſternation of the People was ſo great, that the Alarm reach'd to <hi>Hungary;</hi> for they pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lag'd, burnt, raviſh'd Women and Maids, and carried away all the Cattle, Men, Women, and Maids they could ſeize upon, inſomuch that the number of the Slaves they took amounted to above 50000 perſons, without reckoning the old and the young, whom they kill'd, becauſe they could not carry them away.</p>
               <p>In the mean time King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> was in <hi>Lithua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> where having receiv'd an account of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal News, and not being able to remedy the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order at ſo great a diſtance, he ſent Deputies to <hi>Mendlinges,</hi> to complain of his Treachery in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating his Oath; to which the Cham reply'd, That it was the Fault of his Children and Nephews, and of the inſolent Youth, whom he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain. In the mean time he deſir'd to renew the Alliance he had made with King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> and promis'd to turn his Arms againſt the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> accordingly he march'd the ſame Summer out of the <hi>Crim,</hi> and ravag'd all <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> from whence he brought back an infinite number of Cattle and Slaves. 'Tis plain then that neither the <hi>Polanders</hi> nor any other Chriſtians ought to give credit to thoſe <hi>Barbarians.</hi> But the ſecond Example which I ſhall relate will more plainly demonſtrate the Infidelity of thoſe <hi>Mahometans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſlan</hi> being declar'd Cham of <hi>Tartary,</hi> and his Fidelity being ſuſpected by the Grand Signior, the Port on which the <hi>Tartars</hi> depend reſolv'd to ſend them <hi>Sedetker</hi> for their Prince; which <hi>Aſlan</hi> being inform'd of by ſome of his Friends, and dreading the Grand Signior's power, he ſent to ſupplicate <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III, King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to give him leave, if the Port ſhould declare War againſt him, to retire into his Territories, about the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63304:42"/>
                  <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> with 70000 men, praying him to be inſtead of a Father to him, and promiſing to ſerve him againſt all his enemies: to which <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> replied, That he would receive him as his Son; that he wiſh'd him all Happineſs; that he was ſorry that the Port was diſpleas'd with his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that if the <hi>Turks</hi> ſhould march againſt him, he might retire with ſafety into the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> where he would aſſiſt him with Proviſions and Troops.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polanders,</hi> who guarded the Frontiers of the Kingdom, that they might ſignalize themſelves by ſome brave and important action, reſolv'd to attack <hi>Oczakow,</hi> which belong'd to the <hi>Crim Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars,</hi> that there might be no place left that could incommode thoſe who had retir'd along the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſthenes;</hi> but unfortunately, three days before the <hi>Polanders</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Oczakow, Aſlan</hi> had concluded a Peace with his Couſin <hi>Sedetker,</hi> and <hi>Oczakow</hi> was ſurrender'd to him. The <hi>Polanders</hi> having no deſign to offend <hi>Aſlan,</hi> who they knew was their Ally, nor knowing that the two Couſins were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd, met in their way 300 <hi>Tartars</hi> belonging to the Cham <hi>Aſlan,</hi> whom (believing 'em to be his enemies) they cut to pieces, and afterwards kill'd more of the ſame Nation in other places. Their Courage being elevated with this ſucceſs, they marched ſtrait to <hi>Oczakow,</hi> and at their firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival before the place took 3000 Horſes that were running looſe in the Fields. <hi>Aſlan</hi> underſtanding what the <hi>Polanders</hi> had done, ſent a Meſſenger to <hi>Jaſlowieski</hi> their Commander, to acquaint him, that ſince he was in League with the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> his Brother and good Friend, and had faithfully defended his Country from the Incurſions of the other <hi>Tartars,</hi> he was extreamly ſurpriz'd to hear that the <hi>Polanders</hi> had killed his Men and carried away the Horſes which he kept for the Service of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:63304:42"/>their King; that he entreated him to cauſe 'em to be reſtored to him, without obliging him to right himſelf by force of Arms, to revenge the Injury he had received; nor, from a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor of the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> to give him cauſe to become its moſt cruel enemy, that however he thought fit to inform him, it was neceſſary he ſhould have a private Conference with him, to treat in a friendly manner of the wrongs and loſſes he had ſuſtained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jaſlowieski</hi> being deeply concerned at this News, that did acquaint him with his having offended a Prince, who was one of <hi>Poland</hi>'s Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and alſo fearing the Kings Reſentments; ſent word to <hi>Aſlan,</hi> that he was extremely ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the <hi>Polanders</hi> had offended one of his King's Allies; that this happen'd thoro' a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; not knowing that the <hi>Tartars</hi> whom he met, did belong to him, and thinking they were ſome of the <hi>Crim Tartars</hi> his Enemies, that he prayed him to forgive him a Fault, of which his Ignorance was the only cauſe; that he was ready to reſtore all the Horſes that had been taken then, and gave free leave to the <hi>Tartars</hi> to come for them when they pleas'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aſlan</hi> having received this News with a great deal of Joy, ſent immediately to fetch the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and invited <hi>Jaſlowieski</hi> to come to <hi>Oczakow</hi> with the men that were to bring 'em thither, aſſuring him that he had nothing to fear, and that at his Arrival they would conſult together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſureſt means of making a more ſtrong Friendſhip and Alliance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jaſlowieski</hi> not being able to imagine but that <hi>Aſlan</hi> was ſincere and real, went to him at <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zakow.</hi> But he was no ſooner come thither, but the <hi>Tartars</hi> got on Horſe-back, and ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Polanders,</hi> ſhot their Arrows at them.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:63304:43"/>The <hi>Polanders</hi> ſtood a while without making a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other motion, but covering themſelves with their ſheilds to guard their Bodies from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Then the Cham perceiving the violence which was offered them, ſtept between, ſeeming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hinder the <hi>Tartars</hi> from killing the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders:</hi> But having made a Show of not being able to hinder it, he withdrew, and all the <hi>Polanders</hi> were ſlain.</p>
               <p>It muſt not be imagin'd, that of all the <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,</hi> the <hi>Tartars</hi> only are perfidious; for the <hi>Turks</hi> are as faithleſs, nor ought the Chriſtians to truſt any more to the promiſes of the one, than to thoſe of the others. This is obſervable from their breach of Faith to all the Towns which ſurrendred to them upon Articles in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> during the years one thouſand ſix hundred ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four, and one thouſand ſix hundred ſeventy five: But of all the Towns which they uſed ill, none received a more barbarous Treatment than the town of <hi>Human</hi> in Lower <hi>Podolia,</hi> about five Leagues from the Fontiers of Lower <hi>Volhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> to the Weſt-ward. This Town was very populous, and after ſome Reſiſtance ſurrendred to the <hi>Turks</hi> that had beſeiged it, upon Articles of Capitulation. Theſe Barbarians, who did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to perform them, granted to all the people free leave to remain and dwell in the town and enjoy their Rights and Goods: But as ſoon as they were become Maſters of the Place, they put into practiſe all the Cruelties and Barbarities imaginable: For they raviſhed the Maids and Women, murthered the old People, and young Children, and carryed away into Slavery all thoſe that were able to walk.</p>
               <p>Now let us go back to that which gave me Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to make the foregoing Digreſſion. I ſay, that the Retreat of which I ſpoke before, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63304:43"/>was made by Prince <hi>John Albert,</hi> and other po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Generals may ſerve to ſhew, that the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>Poland</hi> may make war with that ſtate, without being in danger of loſing their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. For the humour of the <hi>Polanders</hi> will be ſure to make them do no more, than barely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themſelves, without fore-ſeeing that the ſame Enemies who attackt 'em once, may attacht them again afterwards, if the Souldiers will give 'em leave to take breath, and recruit their Forces after they have beaten them off. This Aſſertion might be made out by an infinite number of Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and principally of ſo many Irruptions of the <hi>Tartars</hi> into <hi>Poland,</hi> in which the <hi>Tartars</hi> have often been beaten: I'll relate one more that happen'd in the year 1527.</p>
               <p>About the beginning of the year, the <hi>Tartars</hi> marched out of their Country with an Army of twenty ſix thouſand Horſe. They made an Irruption into <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and came as far as <hi>Pinsk,</hi> plundering and deſtroying the Country, burning the Villages, and carrying away the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants into Slavery. The Duke of <hi>Oſtrog</hi> having got a Body of men together, purſued them as they were going home with all the Booty and Slaves which they had got in this Expedition: He came up with them about break of day; at a time, when they did not ſo much as imagine they were followed by the <hi>Poland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> and with the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Lithuanians</hi> which he had got with him, he fell upon them of a ſudden with great Fury, and made ſo great a ſlaughter of them, that very few of them eſcaped. This he did with ſo much the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Eaſe, becauſe he found them all diſmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for they thought themſelves ſo ſecure that they had left their Horſes Grazing in the Fields. Thus almoſt all of them were cut off, except
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63304:44"/>ſeven hundred who were taken Priſoners. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Exploit the Duke of <hi>Oſtrog</hi> returned into <hi>Poland,</hi> and brought back forty thouſand Chriſtians whom the <hi>Tartars</hi> had carryed away in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Slavery. King <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> receiv'd him at <hi>Cracow</hi> with an incredible joy, and not only commended his Courage extremely, but alſo his Judgement and Experience in war. For he was indeed a great Officer; and it may be ſaid, that the Fault which he then committed in not entring into the Body of <hi>Crim Tartary,</hi> as well as that of which he might be ſaid to have been guilty before that, in not beſieging <hi>Smolensko,</hi> after he had entirely routed the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites</hi> in the year one thouſand five hundred and fourteen, are not ſo much the particular Faults of a General, as an Effect of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of all the <hi>Polanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Coſſack Language is a Dialect of the Poliſh Tongue; it is full of Diminutives, and pleaſant Expreſſions. The Common people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> are of the Greek Church; the better ſort are moſt of them Romans or Proteſtants.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> which, as we have ſaid, runs thro' the middle of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> which the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> inhabit, is certainly, next to the <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube,</hi> the greateſt River in <hi>Europe.</hi> It flows out of two Lakes in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the one the Lake of <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> thus called from the town of that Name near its Banks, and the Monaſtery of the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity; the other is called the <hi>Nieper,</hi> and is in the Foreſt of <hi>Wolock,</hi> and from the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> is commonly called the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Nieper.</hi> It is moſt wholeſome and pleaſant to drink, and in ſome places waters many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable Meadows, and has large Fiſhes of a
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63304:44"/>very good ſavour, and without Bones. At a conſiderable diſtance below the Town of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſſi,</hi> it falls between high Rocks and Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which make <hi>Lithuania</hi> inacceſſible on one ſide, except in ten places, where ſome armed <hi>Coſſacks</hi> always keep a Guard either in ſmall Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands or Rocks; whence without any difficulty they cut off the <hi>Tartars,</hi> when they endeavour to get over with their Horſes, which ſwim over large rivers, like Water Spaniels; or if the <hi>Tartars,</hi> ſometimes croſſing the Deſarts beyond <hi>Circaſſi,</hi> get into <hi>Volhinia</hi> and plunder it, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away ſome of the people of <hi>Lithuania</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Slavery, then the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> very often watch them, as they go home with their Booty, and take both that and the Plunderers away.</p>
               <p>Some write that the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were called ſo, from their extraordinary nimbleneſs, the word <hi>Koſa</hi> ſignifying a Goat in the Poliſh Tongue. But that Name ſeems rather to have been given 'em from <hi>Coſac,</hi> a <hi>Ruſſic</hi> Word that ſignifieth a Free-Booter, or plundering Soldier. The Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>Cireches,</hi> called in the Poliſh Tongue <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porow,</hi> has got 'em the name of <hi>Zaporovians:</hi> Some ſay it was from the <hi>Porohis</hi> (Rocks, in the <hi>Ruſſic</hi> Tongue) of the <hi>Boriſthenes</hi> that they got that Name; there being great Rocks, about 50 leagues from the mouth of that River that croſs it over, which the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> paſs when they go to make Incurſions towards the Black Sea beyond the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rohis.</hi> They have in the Iſland their <hi>Skarbnica Wogskowa,</hi> that is, the <hi>Magazines</hi> of their Army, and there they keep all their Booty. Nor could the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> ever be driven out of that Iſland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as it is in a manner wall'd round with very large Reeds, no Galley nor Veſſel of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Bulk can get thither. They want for nothing tho' they never ſow nor reap. Several
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63304:45"/>
                  <hi>Palatines</hi> ſupply 'em with money, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces they inhabit, and which they guard, furniſh 'em with Neceſſaries. They are all Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, but either of very ſlender Fortunes, young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Brothers, or ſuch as have no ſhare of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, as the Law of the Nation orders it. They are commonly divided into Troops of 120 when they guard the Frontiers; beſides their Servants that follow in the like number, and who alight, if their Maſters Horſe is diſabled. They fight covered with Sheep-Skins, ſtuft ſo as to be Launce and Javelin Proof. Their Arms are Piſtols and Carbines, and Seymitars, that hang at their Girdle faſtened with a Gilt Chain. In the Fight they always ride to and fro; as if they deſigned to attack the Enemy on diverſe ſides, and thus rout them the more eaſily; the Foe not being able to know on which ſide they are like to be moſt preſt. They uſe Kettle-Drums, but never Trumpets, unleſs before their General, whom they chuſe among themſelves; and who uſed to take the Oath of Fidelity to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> Their <hi>Czaiki,</hi> or hollow trunks of trees, which they uſe to make Incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, are not altogether unlike the Canoes which the Indians uſe. They are covered with Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hides, with Holes for as many men as each Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noe will carry, commonly 40 or 50; and they faſten thoſe Hides ſo to their Bodies with peices of Leather that no water can get in; yet they are not obſtructed by them from Rowing or uſing their Arms. Fifty of theſe often go out together, uſually keeping pretty near the Shoar; and if a ſtorm happens to ariſe, or they find they are not able to cope with the Enemies Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, they make the beſt of their way to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes Meoticae,</hi> ſink their Canoes, dive into the water; and draw their breath thro' a Reed,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63304:45"/>which they keep ſo fixt to their mouth, as to let nothing but the end of it be above the water.</p>
               <p>There there lye hid till the danger is over; and, then having thrown the water out of the Canoes, they fall unexpectedly upon the Gallies, and often make themſelves Maſters of them. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the end of the ſeaſon theſe Adventurers ſeparate, and go each to his own home, after they have appointed their Rendezvous for the enſuing Spring near the Iſlands of the <hi>Boriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Coſſacks</hi> are of a good Stature, ſtrong, dexterous, nimble, liberal, great Lovers of their Liberty, uneaſy under any Yoke, indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable, bold, and good Soldiers; but great Drunkards, and very treacherous. They are much given to Fiſhing and Hunting. They have this peculiar to them that none knows how to prepare Salt-Petre better than they do, and their Country uſed to ſupply ſeveral parts of <hi>Europe</hi> with it. In Summer they are mightily peſtered with Flies, and Graſhoppers, which fly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in ſuch vaſt numbers that they make a kind of Cloud, and darken the Air; for they fly in ſwarms that are ſometimes ſeveral miles long, and will deſtroy the Corn they light on, tho' it be green, in leſs than two hours time. Theſe inſects live but ſix months: Rain kills 'em. and the Northern Wind blows them into the black Sea.</p>
               <p>The firſt Revolt of the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> was under their General <hi>John Fodhovia,</hi> who was worſted, and then beheaded; this happened after King <hi>Stephen Battori</hi>'s death; for by that time they were become formidable, by reaſon of their native Valour, and being brought under mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Diſcipline. They had been allowed many Privileges by that Great Prince, beſides their
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:63304:46"/>Common Pay; and he had joyned a Body of Poliſh Horſe to them, and appointed the fourth part of his Cuſtoms for their ſubſiſtance; for which reaſon they are called <hi>Quartani.</hi> The vaſt Country beyond the Towns of <hi>Blacklew, Bar,</hi> and <hi>Kiovia</hi> had begun to be inhabited, and ſeveral Towns and Caſtles to be built by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies from neighbouring Provinces; and had not the change of religion, which the Poliſh Lords would have impos'd upon the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> occaſioned the revolt, greater Improvements might have been made; and the ſecond which happened in the year 1596 might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. Then the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> had ſome Advantage over the Poliſh Army commanded by General <hi>Zolskiewski,</hi> and looked upon themſelves as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible: yet that able Warrier found means to preſs them ſo cloſe, that he forced 'em to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him their General <hi>Nolevaiko,</hi> who was ſerved like his Predeceſſor. Then they revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a third time in 1637, as has been ſaid, but with as ill ſucceſs as before; and the Loſs of their General and chief Officers at that time was attended with the forfeiture of their Privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and of the town of <hi>Trethimirow,</hi> and alſo with the ſuppreſſion of their Souldery. After theſe diſgraces when they were ready to try their Fortune again, they were at laſt promiſed a re-eſtabliſhment; but this promiſe was not kept, for there was a new modell'd Militia eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and their General was often removed. Then the <hi>Polanders</hi> found the Inconveniency of the change by the Incurſions of the <hi>Tartars;</hi> and King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> the IV, having a deſign to make war with the <hi>Turks,</hi> the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> were reſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon the antient Foot. But awhile after this upon ſome new occaſions they ſhook off the Yoke of <hi>Poland</hi> under <hi>Chonelensk;</hi> and ſince that, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:63304:46"/>ſometimes partly ſubmitted, and at others diſclaim'd the Authority of the republick, their Country is now much depopulated, and they are divided among themſelves. Some obey the <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covites,</hi> and ſome the <hi>Poles,</hi> and many of them ſide ſometimes with the <hi>Turks,</hi> ſometimes with the <hi>Poles</hi> and ſometimes with the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they are ſucceſsful, or offer them more advantageous Terms.</p>
               <p>It may not be amiſs to ſay ſomething of the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> in particular, before we give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in general of the State of <hi>Poland,</hi> of which their Country now makes a Part.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lithuania</hi> is for the moſt part very full of large Woods and Foreſts, as alſo Ponds and Lakes: Some of them of ſuch an extent that they ſeem a kind of Sea. The Inhabitants are not leſs jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of their Liberty than the <hi>Poles,</hi> taking great care that their Rights may not be infring'd by that Nation, their Aſſociates, on one ſide, and that the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> their Neighbours may not enſlave them, as they have often endeavour'd; for tho' they agree with the latter in ſome things, as in their drink, which is cheifly <hi>Mead</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theglin,</hi> as alſo <hi>Brandy</hi> which they drink alike to great exceſs; alſo in their way of Ploughing and Sowing, and many other matters in point of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, yet they have always lookt upon them as an inveterate and treacherous Enemy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Peaſants</hi> are not leſs miſerable there, and yet more ignorant than thoſe of the Kingdom of <hi>Poland.</hi> They are in general uſed like Slaves by their Maſters, and often very barbarouſly by the Servants, and Attendants of the Nobility, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally in time of War; for then they make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of entring their Huts, and plundering what they can. The poor Ruſticks have no admittance into their Lord's Preſence without Preſents, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63304:47"/>if it be their Fortune to have acceſs to them, they are commonly directed to make their complaint to the Judges, who are ſure to do them but little good, unleſs the <hi>Plaintifs</hi> bring them Preſents to recommend their Petitions; ſo that every word of the Judge in <hi>Lithuania</hi> is money. Four days commonly, and ſometimes five or ſix in a week, the Wretches muſt work for their Lords: On Mundays they are allowed to drudge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and as they have not time enough on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther days, they frequently do all manner of work on ſundays, (for the <hi>Peaſants</hi> keep no manner of Saints Holy-days there) having that alſo parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular to them with the <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> that if you ask them, why they preſume to work on the Lord's day, they will anſwer you with this queſtion, whether they muſt not eat on the Lord's day? They are oblig'd to pay a Tax three or four times a year towards defraying the charges of guarding the <hi>Frontiers,</hi> beſides ſeveral other heavy Impoſitions of their Lord's deviſing. Their Bread is the browneſt and courſeſt, the Wheat and Ears of Corn being commonly ground toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They have very little Horſes, which yet are excellent for ſervice, either in War or Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry: They do not plough the Ground with Iron, but with Wood, which ſeems the ſtranger, becauſe their ſoil is generally hard and not ſandy. When they go to plough, they take along with them ſeveral pieces of Wood, which they uſe inſtead of Plough ſhares, and when one is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they preſently clap another into the Plough. A certain great man, to eaſe thoſe poor men in that hard labour, caus'd ſeveral Iron Plough-ſhares to be fabricated; but as the following years by reaſon of the badneſs of the weather there were no plentiful Harveſts, they <hi>Peaſants</hi> poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively aſcribed the ſterility of the Ground to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63304:47"/>thoſe Iron Plough-ſhares; inſomuch that to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void a ſedition, they were permitted to uſe their old Way. Their Dreſs is generally a courſe Aſh-colour'd Habit, with a ſort of Buskings or Boots, made of the skins of Beaſts after they have taken off the hair. They have a ſort of light Carts, about which they make uſe of no manner of Iron-work; and as they never greaſe them, when many of them are driven together, the Axel-trees make a ſtrange uncouth ſort of a Noiſe. In ſome places in the Country, if any one of the <hi>Peaſants</hi> has committed a Crime for which his Lord thinks fit to condemn him to die, the Criminal is obliged to hang himſelf, and be his own Executioner; and if he refuſes, he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to do it with Threats and Blows. As 'tis not many hundred years ſince the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> became Chriſtians, there are ſome of the meaner ſort ſtill in the Country ſo ſtupidly ignorant as to retain many things of their Anceſtors Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worſhip; theſe keep a ſort of ſwarthy ſerpents which they look upon as their tutelary Divinities, feeding them with great Care and Reſpect, and attributing their ill Fortune to their neglect of thoſe Animals. Not long ago the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuanian</hi> Ruſticks us'd to offer ſacrifices about the latter end of <hi>October</hi> to an imaginary Deity whom they called <hi>Ziemiennick.</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Samogitia</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia</hi> us'd to do the like. Neither were thoſe of <hi>Livonia</hi> leſs idolatrous, having been taught Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, not only by preaching and apoſtolical Admonitions, but alſo by force of Arms. This gave Birth to the Order of <hi>Livonian</hi> Knights; who firſt ſtyl'd themſelves Sword-bearing Fryers, or Brothers; and theſe finding themſelves unable to fight the <hi>Livonians</hi> out of their ancient Belief and Liberty, in time call'd in the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Knights of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> to their aſſiſtance, by which
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:63304:48"/>means they at laſt prevailed. Being at laſt incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated with them by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> IX, the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonian</hi> Maſters were oblig'd to pay homage and certain Tributes to the Maſters of <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> till the time of <hi>Albert</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who about the year 1513 parted with that yearly Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute and Homage for a large ſumm of Money. Thus the <hi>Livonian</hi> Knights, by degrees and alſo the ſeveral Biſhops and Arch Biſhops became ſo many Soveraigns, till after many Wars, the whole Country of <hi>Livonia</hi> was ſubdued by <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Auguſtus</hi> King of <hi>Poland;</hi> tho' ſince it has been quitted to the <hi>Swedes,</hi> who are now Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of it.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>Polanders</hi> have at all times had an Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to War: Inſomuch, that at firſt they continually went arm'd, as if they had been juſt ready to engage their Enemies; and indeed all their buſineſs was to rove about and change their Station from time to time, more like Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, than like ſetled Inhabitants of any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Place; neither were they ever in ſafety, for they were on one ſide always ready to be attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Germans,</hi> and by the <hi>Scythians</hi> on the other: So that they had many Wars and bloody Conflicts with both thoſe Nations. Yet tho' there never was any ſolid Friendſhip between them and the <hi>Germans,</hi> at laſt their way of Living, and the Care they took to keep their word to one another, made them Accuſtom themſelves more to them than to the <hi>Scythians.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:63304:48"/>
               <p>In the beginning, the <hi>Polanders</hi> had neither Laws nor Princes to govern them, and liv'd after an uncontroul'd manner; but as no Nation can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main long without Rulers, principally in time of War, they afterwards us'd to chuſe among themſelves a Chief, who was commonly the moſt Famous perſon for Valour among them, and they us'd to obey him as a Leader: but his Authority laſted no longer than the War. All the People reſolutely followed him, Arm'd with Bows, and Arrows, Partiſans and long Launces; the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men attended their Husbands, pretending to witchcraft &amp; the Knowledge of the future Events of Battles. The Men never us'd to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to flight; &amp; whoſoever ran away was never ſuffer'd to return to his Party: This being eſteem'd the greateſt ſhame and ignominy among them. They came in time to have Knights, which was the next Dignity to their Chief Captain, and thoſe were alſo never choſen but out of the Braveſt; after they had ſignaliz'd their Valour againſt the Enemy. They Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip'd the Sun, the Moon, Mars, and diverſe other falſe Divinities, having certain Places and Rites appropriated to pay them their Adoration. They buried the dead in Foreſts, and Fields, laying high heaps of ſtones over their Tombes, as may be ſtill ſeen in many places in <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> others, according to the <hi>Roman</hi> way, us'd to burn the dead Bodies, and layd up the aſhes in Urns: Few things ſatisfi'd them for their Food. They had nothing which they properly call'd their own, except their Bow, their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſan, and Launce: They purchaſed what ever they wanted of others by the way of Barter or Exchange. They wore courſe Garments made of the skins of Wild Beaſts, down to their heels; deſpiſing all Rich Dreſſes, Treaſures, Houſes
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:63304:49"/>and poſſeſſions: They made an end of all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Controverſies, by the way of Arms in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>This was their way of Living then, which is not yet altogether aboliſhed in ſome places. But in Proceſs of Time, Princes and then Kings were brought in among them: Yet with a more limited authority than in other Countries, and after an Elective manner. As for Laws, King <hi>Caſimir</hi> introduced the <hi>Teutonick</hi> there, in the Year 1368. and Eſtabliſhed a Soveraign Court of Juſtice, at the Caſtle of <hi>Cracow,</hi> as in the middle of his Kingdom; for <hi>Poland</hi> was then of a far greater Extent than 'tis now, ſo that the City of <hi>Cracow</hi> was, in a manner in the middle of that Great State; whereas at this time, it may be almoſt call'd a Frontier Town, ſince it is but twelve Leagues from thence to <hi>Sileſia,</hi> which was then a province of <hi>Poland,</hi> and now belongs to the Emperor of <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> on the account of the Kingdom of <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Kings us'd always to have a right to make the People take up arms, as often as it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and every Man was excited to give ſome proofs of Valor, becauſe there was no other means to riſe, and obtain the Right of Nobility; neither was there any other Reward to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As for thoſe who were not ſtirr'd up by the deſire of honour and advancement, the fear of puniſhment us'd to prevail with them; for thoſe who did not obey the King's Orders were either whipt with Cords, or cudgel'd into fighting, which convinc'd the reſt of the Neceſſity of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king arms with all ſpeed.</p>
               <p>In thoſe days it was not the Cuſtom to levy Military Men with Mony in <hi>Poland,</hi> for there was none at that time, in that Kingdom, where they then till'd the Ground, barely to ſupply the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63304:49"/>of the Inhabitants, and had no thoughts of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Corn out of the Country, nor of importing thoſe things that ſerve only for Superfluity and good Chear.</p>
               <p>The Soyl, which is fruitful of it ſelf, ſuppli'd every one with a ſufficient ſubſiſtance; ſo that the <hi>Peaſants</hi> were not compell'd to work hard; for if they wrought never ſo little, they did enough for their Maſters, and for themſelves. But as ſoon as the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen began to exchange Corn for foreign Merchandiſes, and <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Luxury</hi> were brought into that Kingdom, the Military Vigour began to abate, and the Slavery of the <hi>Peaſants</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intollerable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poland</hi> is now properly a Republick, and 'tis by that Name that the <hi>Polanders</hi> call it, looking upon their King as being no more than the head of their Common wealth. This makes them leſſen the King's authority more and more, when a new one is to be elected, ſtill enlarging their own privileges, and taking care that his preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive may not grow too great: They are indeed ſo jealous of their Liberty and ſo afraid of loſing it, that they will not have any fortyfied towns upon the <hi>Frontiers,</hi> for fear the King ſhould put a Garriſon in it, and ſo ſhould make himſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Maſter of all the Nobility by degrees. That ſentiment is ſo ſtrongly rooted within their hearts that they prepoſſeſs their Children with it betimes, making them believe that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Freedom would ſoon be loſt, if ever they ſuffered any town to be fortyfied upon the <hi>Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers.</hi> But they do not conſider, that while they deſign to ſhun a great Evil, they fall into another that is worſe; ſince their Neighbours who are all of them their Enemies, finding the Country open, eaſily invade it, and from time to time make themſelves Maſters of ſome part of their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:63304:50"/>ſtate before the <hi>Polanders</hi> can be in a Condition to oppoſe their Irruptions, as the <hi>Swedes</hi> did, which I have already mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Republick of <hi>Poland</hi> is compoſed of three Orders, the King, the Senate, and the Nobility or Gentry. Thus all the Rites and Privileges are joyntly holden by thoſe three Orders; inſomuch that there can be no Laws made nor abrogated, no War levied, no alliance concluded with Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, no Impoſitions laid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> nor no money coyned, but with the joynt Conſent of the whole Republick, or of the Senators that are deputed for that end; therefore ſome of theſe are always near the King's perſon, in order to preſerve the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of the</hi> KING.</head>
               <p>THe King diſpoſes of all the conſiſtorial Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and of many others; as alſo of all the Offices and Places of profit in the Gift of the Crown; for he cannot keep them to himſelf, and is obliged to beſtow them upon the Gentlemen of <hi>Poland,</hi> and not upon Foreigners, tho' they have never ſo much perſonal Merit, or have done never ſo much ſervice to the Republick; for the <hi>Polanders</hi> are ſo jealous of Foreigners, that they cannot endure that the King ſhould make them any connderable Gratification: As for Inſtance.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of King <hi>Stephen Batori,</hi> the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians</hi> had been very ſerviceable to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in the War againſt the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> Now that brave Prince, who had invited many of 'em into <hi>Poland,</hi> to repell that encroaching Enemy with their Aſſiſtance, thought himſelf obliged to beſtow ſome ſuitable Rewards upon them; but he had no ſooner done this, but that ſeveral of the Great Men of <hi>Poland</hi> were ſtrangely exaſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, particularly the Great General who reſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it ſo highly that he reſigned his place upon that Account: Many others alſo murmur'd open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt that Prince; which uſage may ſeem the more ungenerous and ungrateful, ſeeing they were ſo much obliged to that Warlike King, who had atcheived braver and greater Actions for <hi>Poland,</hi> than any of his Predeceſſors. Thus all that a Foreigner can pretend to in that Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, can amount to no more than the obtaining the Command of a Regiment of Foot, or the Grant of ſome little Royal Gift. Beſides, that
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63304:51"/>he may be duely qualified for the poſſeſſion of it; he muſt firſt be made a Gentleman of <hi>Poland,</hi> for otherwiſe the King cannot beſtow any ſuch thing upon him; however there are ſome little Royal Gifts and Benefices, which a man may hold with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being a Gentleman of <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in the main, 'tis ſo certain, that there is a neceſſity of being made a Gentleman of <hi>Poland,</hi> to poſſeſs an Eſtate or Place of conſiderable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in that Kingdom, that King <hi>Stephen Battori,</hi> whom we juſt now mentioned, thought fit to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the <hi>Indigenate,</hi> that is the right of Nobility, to two of his Kinſ-men at the Seſſions of the Diet which he had ſummon'd to meet the 13 of <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> 1386. For, as he had no Children, he was deſirous of advancing thoſe of his Brother, and was perſwaded that this Naturalization would enable him to prefer them to ſomething more conſiderable. But that Great Prince was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by Death, in the fifty fourth year of his age, after he had reigned ten years.</p>
               <p>One would be apt to think, that this mighty Power, which the King of <hi>Poland</hi> has to diſpoſe of ſo many places of Truſt and Profit, of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Lands by Royal Tenure, and of ſo many Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefices, muſt need gain him the Love and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe on whom they are conſerr'd, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to follow the Dictates of his Will, with a blind Obedience; for there are few Kings in <hi>Europe,</hi> that have more favours to beſtow than that Prince, neither can any other in leſs time make a very rich Lord, of a poor Gentleman. But it happens quite otherwiſe: For, not to ſpeak of the Temper of the <hi>Polanders,</hi> who natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally are none of the moſt grateful; they know too well that their King cannot diſpoſe of any of thoſe Preferments to any others, but only to themſelves, and they believe that, when he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63304:51"/>grants them any ſuch Places, Revenues or Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he only gives 'em back what belongs to them by their native Right; and that thus his grant is not ſo much an act of Grace, as a piece of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. The rather, becauſe, as I have already ſaid, the King neither ought nor can keep or convert any of thoſe Revenues to his own particular Uſe or Benefit; nor can he ſuppreſs any Place of Truſt or Profit in the Kingdom. Beſides, the Nobility would not eaſily ſuffer him to give the leaſt thing to Foreigners; for that powerful Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſo jealous of its Liberty, that it will not give the King the leaſt Opportunity of encreaſing his Prerogative and Authority, by gaining crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that would ſolely depend upon him.</p>
               <p>The King does not ſucceed his Predeceſſor; no, not tho' he were his Father. But he is free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elected by the Nobility, who meet by their Deputies in a General Diet, which always ought to be kept near <hi>Warſaw.</hi> However, though a King's Children have no manner of right in the Republick, yet is there always a due regard had to them: Inſomuch that 'tis commonly one of them upon whom the Election falls, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of his Father. But nevertheleſs, this is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways done with the ſame Ceremonies, and ſtill obſerving the ſame rules as if a Stranger were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected; the <hi>Polanders</hi> taking great care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their right of not chuſing one of the decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed King's Family, believing that their Happineſs lies chiefly in the Power which they have to make choiſe of what Prince they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>They have not only a due regard to the Sons of their Kings, their Conſideration extends al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to their Daughters, and even to their Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, of which I will here relate ſome Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:63304:52"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> being dead the 13 of <hi>December</hi> 1382, and having left no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Iſſue than two Daughters, the Republick met at <hi>Radom</hi> in order to proceed to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a New King. Part of the Senators inclin'd to chuſe <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> who had wedded the eldeſt of thoſe two Princeſſes. The other part were for <hi>Hedwige,</hi> who was the youngeſt and not yet of age to be married. Thus after many Conſultations it was reſolved at laſt in the Diet that was kept at <hi>Vielicza,</hi> that ſome Deputies ſhould be ſent by the Republick to Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who was then in <hi>Hungary</hi> with the Princeſs <hi>Hedwige</hi> her Daughter, to entreat her to ſend that Lady into <hi>Poland,</hi> and inform her that the Senate had reſolved to crown her Queen, and to elect a Prince that would be in a condition to marry her. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> who had no mind that this Princeſs ſhould marry ſo young, and beſides that, had a Deſign to wed her to the Duke of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to whom ſhe had been betroth'd in King <hi>Lewis</hi> her Father's life time, ſent to acquaint the Diet which was then held at <hi>Seradia,</hi> that ſhe would ſend the Princeſs <hi>Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wige</hi> into <hi>Poland</hi> at the following <hi>Eaſter;</hi> but that ſhe deſired that ſhe might return after that into <hi>Hungary</hi> to remain with her the ſpace of three years, till ſhe were of age to be married.</p>
               <p>The Senators of <hi>Poland,</hi> having receiv'd this anſwer, did not think fit to proceed to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a King, till the Arrival of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, according to the promiſe of the Queen her Mother: But finding that ſhe had not ſent her into <hi>Poland</hi> at the time appointed, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate did a ſecond time depute ſome of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to let the Queen know, that tho' the Affairs of the Republick of <hi>Poland</hi> were in ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as highly required the preſence of a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63304:52"/>King, yet they were contented to ſtay for the Princeſs till the Month of <hi>November</hi> 1383. Now the Queen having neglected to ſend her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Hedwige</hi> that ſecond time, the <hi>Polanders</hi> ſent her ſome Deputies a third time, about the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the following year. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> having alſo broke her word to them that time, the Senate being met at <hi>Radom,</hi> ſent one ſingle Deputy to acquaint her, that it had been reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v'd in the Diet, not to ſend any more to her, and that, if ſhe had a mind that her daughter <hi>Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wige</hi> ſhould been Queen, they would ſtill wait for her till the 8 of <hi>May;</hi> but that, if after that time ſhe did not appear, the Republick would proceed according as might be thought moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable in the preſſing neceſſity which they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured under for want of a King.</p>
               <p>The Queen having heard the Senate's final reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, inſtead of ſending her Daughter <hi>Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wige</hi> into <hi>Poland,</hi> advis'd her Son-in-Law <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi> to go thither with ſome Forces to govern the Republick till her Daughter <hi>Hedwige</hi> were grown up. But as ſoon as the <hi>Polanders</hi> heard of <hi>Sigſmund's</hi> Approach, they rais'd ſome men with all ſpeed to oppoſe that Prince, whom they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly hated. At the ſame time they ſent to let him know, that if he preſumed to enter <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> they would declare themſelves his open E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies; this obliged him to go back, and ſend to deſire them to ſtay till the <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Princeſs <hi>Hedwige</hi>'s Coming. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they ſtaid; and not only till then, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo till the month of <hi>October</hi> after that, at which time ſhe arriv'd at <hi>Cracow,</hi> where immediately ſhe was crown'd Queen of <hi>Poland</hi> on St. <hi>Hedwige</hi> of <hi>Lignitz</hi>'s Day.</p>
               <p>I thought fit to relate this paſſage to de non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate that the <hi>Poles</hi> have no common Regard to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63304:53"/>the royal progeny; nor do I think that any thing can illuſtrate that Reſpect more than the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with which they waited; and that too at a time while they had ſo much need of Electing a King. For the Kingdom was then diſturb'd, not only by the Duke of <hi>Maſovia,</hi> who having a conſiderable party in the Republick, endeavour'd to be made King of <hi>Poland,</hi> as being one of the royal Family of <hi>Caſimir</hi> the Great; but the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuanians</hi> and the <hi>Ruſſians</hi> alſo were not a little troubleſome, and there were then many Robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Plunderings, and ſtrange diſorders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted every where, with Impunity, becauſe the Kingdom was deſtitute of a Head.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Hedwige</hi> had been crowned, and the Republick was ſtudying how to get her a proper Husband, <hi>Jagello</hi> Duke of <hi>Lithuania</hi> ſent his two Brothers to her with very conſiderable Preſents, and at the ſame time offered to renounce his ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Worſhip, and turn Chriſtian, as alſo to endeavour to make his Subjects do the ſame, and to unite his Dutchy to the Crown of <hi>Poland</hi> for the future, and preſent the Republick with two hundred thouſand Livres; all this provided he might marry <hi>Hedwige,</hi> and be elected King of <hi>Poland.</hi> Theſe advantageous Propoſals were hearkened to, and granted, and accordingly he was elected King. By theſe means <hi>Lithuania</hi> was in time united to <hi>Poland,</hi> and from an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditaty State, is become a part of an Elective Republick. Which change ſome of the Kings of the race of <hi>Jagello</hi> did not altogether ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, nor can it be ſaid, that it was fully effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the Extinction of that Family; for, being unwilling to deprive their Heirs of an Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Right, by ſubmitting to make <hi>Lithuania</hi> elective, they ſtill delayed the Confirmation of the Convention, alledging that the Nobility and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:63304:53"/>people of <hi>Lithuania</hi> would never ſuffer it, leſt by ſuch an Union they ſhould loſe their antient degree and dignity. Things remain'd in this condition while there were Princes of that Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be elected: At laſt the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that it was extinct as to Males, after the death of King <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus,</hi> and being afraid of Irruptions from their incroaching Neighbours the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> they conſented to an Union.</p>
               <p>The Example of <hi>Stephen Batori,</hi> verifies alſo what we have already ſaid of the regard which the <hi>Poles</hi> have to the Royal Family in point of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. For, that Prince was choſen King of <hi>Poland</hi> only upon Condition that he ſhould mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Princeſs <hi>Anne,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Sigiſmund Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> who dyed without Iſſue, and was the laſt of the Family of the <hi>Jagellones.</hi> I muſt own that there were ſeveral Reaſons which concur'd to cauſe the <hi>Polanders</hi> to impoſe that Condition on <hi>Stephen Batori;</hi> for thus they did not only expreſs their reſpect to the <hi>Jagellonian</hi> Family, but avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Expences which they muſt otherwiſe have been at, for the maintaining of two Princeſſes. But that which engaged them the rather to act thus, was the Abdication of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Valds</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> who had refuſed to marry her; for that Prince having received the News of the death of <hi>Charles</hi> IX his Brother, privately left <hi>Poland</hi> the 18 of <hi>June</hi> 1574, and returned to <hi>France,</hi> after he had been crown'd at <hi>Cracow</hi> the 24 of <hi>February,</hi> and had remain'd five months with the Republick.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polanders</hi> therefore, believing that they would thus more ſtrongly bind <hi>Stephen Batori</hi> to their Intereſt, oblig'd him to marry the Princeſs <hi>Anne,</hi> tho' ſhe was ſomewhat elderly. But this prov'd of a very unhappy Conſequence for all
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:63304:54"/>the Church of <hi>Sweden:</hi> For <hi>Stephen Battori</hi> dying afterwards at <hi>Iroane,</hi> on the 12 of <hi>December</hi> 1586, without leaving any Iſſue, the Republick ſtill having a regard to the Family of the <hi>Jagellones,</hi> choſe <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the third, the Son of <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Sweden</hi> and of <hi>Catharine,</hi> Siſter to <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus,</hi> and thus Nephew to Queen <hi>Anne, Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen Battoris</hi>'s Widow. By reaſon of which E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> being oblig'd to make <hi>Poland</hi> the place of his reſidence, left the Government of <hi>Sweden</hi> to his Unkle the Duke of <hi>Sudermania,</hi> who afterwards made himſelf Maſter of the Kingdom where he aboliſhed the <hi>Roman Religion,</hi> and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd the <hi>Lutheran</hi> which he publickly profeſt.</p>
               <p>What I have ſaid of the <hi>Polanders,</hi> as to their preferring the Offspring of their Kings before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is ſo true, that from the beginning of their acknowledging a Regal State, even at a time when they were all ſtrangers to the Chriſtian religion, they choſe <hi>Venda</hi> to be their Queen, being the only perſon that was left of the Line of <hi>Cracus</hi> their third King. Long after this, <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Hungary</hi> having choſen for his Succeſſor, <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who had wedded his eldeſt Daughter; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick met at <hi>Radom,</hi> in the year 1312, and the Diet paſt a Conſtitution, whereby <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> was excluded; however declaring at the ſame time, that there ſhould be a due regard had to the Princeſs his Wife. The Great Men of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom gave afterwards their Votes for <hi>Ziemowitz,</hi> Duke of <hi>Maſovia,</hi> upon condition he would wed <hi>Hedwige</hi> who was King <hi>Lewis</hi>'s Daughter. But Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> her Mother would not conſent that her Daughter ſhould marry ſo inconſiderable a Prince as was the Duke of <hi>Maſovia,</hi> tho' he was of the Royal Houſe of <hi>Caſimir</hi> the Great.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid, that the <hi>Polanders</hi> have not only
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:63304:54"/>ſome Conſideration for all thoſe of the Royal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; but that they have alſo a great regard to the Widows of their Kings. It was for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that they oblig'd King <hi>John Caſimir</hi> to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Queen <hi>Maria Aloiſia</hi> the Widow of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus</hi> the fourth, his Brother, who died without Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue. This will further appear, by the Propoſal that was made to Queen <hi>Eleonor</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Widow of King <hi>Michael,</hi> during the Diet of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in the year 1674. For the <hi>Poles</hi> inſiſted upon that Queen's marrying the Prince of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg,</hi> for whom the French us'd their Intereſt; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that on the 18 of <hi>May,</hi> four Biſhops came to that Queen, and aſſur'd her, that provided ſhe would conſent to wed that Prince, he would certainly be elected, and that by this means the minds of all the different parties would be re-uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But Queen <hi>Eleonor,</hi> who is the Emperors Siſter, and who then did nothing but by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Chancellor <hi>Patz</hi> and the motions of the Miniſters of the Court of <hi>Vienna,</hi> made them no other anſwer, but that ſhe had ſome Friends in the Diet who would take care of her Intereſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A drew Trezebſck<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cracow,</hi> was one of the four that were deputed on that account to the Queen, and afterwards to Chancellour <hi>Patz,</hi> who as I have ſaid, was her chief Councellor. But that Chancellor, who had a mind the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould fall on Prince <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> whom the Emperor did very earneſtly recommend, made anſwer, That he would have no other but the Prince of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> and not the Prince of <hi>Newburg.</hi> The event ſoon convinc'd him of his error, and made him know, that he had taken wrong Meaſures, and not underſtood his true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. For as he had govern'd King <hi>Michael,</hi> and ſtill had an abſolute ſway over the mind of the Queen, he might eaſily have govern'd alſo the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63304:55"/>Prince of <hi>Newburgh</hi> who was young, and whom his Queen might have enclin'd as ſhe would have thought fit.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor <hi>Batz</hi> was ſo poſitive in his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that it was a very difficult matter to make him alter it: He was a Man of his word, and when ever he had engag'd it to any body, he was ſure to keep it inviolably, his own Intreſt not being able to make him Recant. And indeed the Conference which he had with the Prince of <hi>Newburgh's</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador at <hi>Belveder</hi> (whither I kept him Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) made it plainly appear that his own Intereſt alone was not ſufficient to make him alter his Meaſures. For I underſtood afterwards from him, that conſiderable Offers had been made him, and that it had been Repreſented to him, what Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages the Election of the Prince of <hi>Newburgh</hi> would bring to all his Family. But all this did not in the leaſt affect him; and ſo that Conference was to no purpoſe, neither for him nor for the Prince of <hi>Newburgh:</hi> Nay, even his Lady, tho' a French-woman, of the Houſe of <hi>Mailly,</hi> could never be brought to ſide with the French Faction, tho' very Advantageous Offers were made to her. She was Lady of Honour to Queen <hi>Eleonor,</hi> and had promis'd her to be faithful to her, which ſhe did Inviolably. This unſhaken Fidelity in an <hi>Auſtrian</hi> French-woman was ſuch, that even the French themſelves could not but admire and eſteem it, it being their Nature to Prefer that Vertue to all the Advantages that can be propos'd to them, to engage them to part with it.</p>
               <p>France had then almoſt all the Princes of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope its Enemies, but was ſtill ſo Fortunate, that Heaven would not ſomuch as ſuffer her to compaſs thoſe Things which She moſt Earneſtly deſir'd, when in proceſs of Time thoſe Things might have been Prejudicial to her Intereſt. Thus the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:63304:55"/>Providence would not permit the Prince of <hi>Newburgh</hi> to be choſen King of <hi>Poland,</hi> tho' France us'd all her Indeavours to make the Choice fall upon him; which if it had taken effect, would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have been diſadvantageous to that Nation; for, that Prince would not have fail'd to have prov'd her Enemy, as did his Father ſoon after, having Married his Daughter to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
               <p>I return now to what I have already ſaid, that it is in the King of <hi>Poland's</hi> Power to diſpoſe of all the Places and Offices in the Kingdom and Dutchy. Thoſe on whom he beſtows them, ought not only to be Gentlemen of <hi>Poland,</hi> but ought alſo to be poſſeſt of ſome Eſtate in Land, in the State or Country, to which the ſaid Place or Office Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belongs. So that a Gentleman whoſe Eſtate lyes all in the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> cannot have an Office in the Dutchy of <hi>Lithuania;</hi> neither can he whoſe Eſtate is altogether in the Dutchy, have an Office in the Kingdom; which Order is regularly obſerv'd, tho' the <hi>Polanders</hi> and the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> are now properly but one Body, and are no more than one People; differing but in few things as to their manner of Living. Nevertheleſs in the time that I liv'd in <hi>Lithuania,</hi> I have obſerv'd that the Politer part of the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> come nearer to to the <hi>French</hi> than the <hi>Polanders</hi> do in all their wayes, and particularly in their Briskneſs, and Gayty tho' <hi>Lithuania</hi> is remoter from <hi>France</hi> than <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the King of <hi>Poland</hi> enters a City, the Magiſtrates ought alwayes to bring him the Keys; and he has power to make his own Regiment of Guards keep watch at the Gates. The Citizens of <hi>Dantzick</hi> alone, have the priviledge of Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own Gates when the King enters that City; nay, they have a Right to hinder any Forces
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63304:56"/>from entering with the King, and to go the Rounds all Night in the Streets, as long as he ſtays with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their Walls. But it muſt indeed be Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd, that <hi>Dantzic,</hi> which is one of the moſt Conſiderable Hans-Towns, is properly a free Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, under the Protection of <hi>Poland.</hi> Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it has all the marks of an Entire Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty: For it condemns to Death without Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, even the Gentlemen of <hi>Poland</hi> themſelves, if they happen to commit any Crime there that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves a Capital Puniſhment. It has a Mint of its own, and Coyns its own Mony, without any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Leave or Permiſſion obtain'd from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of <hi>Poland,</hi> tho' they Stamp the Kings Image upon it; and they are not Oblig'd to take in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the baſe Mony of that State; however, tho' the people of <hi>Dantzic</hi> may thus be reckon'd a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public and particular Soveraign State, they are nevertheleſs Oblig'd to ſend to the <hi>Diet</hi> ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, who never fail to ſpeak in the Name of the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Dantzic,</hi> and who Conſequently never fail to be Interrupted by the Chancellor, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deſires them to be Silent, forbidding them to take that Quality upon them, which yet they are ſure to take afterwards in the following <hi>Diets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dantzic</hi> is Scituated about a League from the <hi>Baltic</hi> Sea, and almoſt at the mouth of the River <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>istula.</hi> That City, till the Year 1170 conſiſted only of ſome Fiſhermen's Cottages, but has rais'd it ſelf ſince that time, to ſuch a height of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that it paſſes now for one of the Principal Cities of <hi>Europe:</hi> It muſt indeed be own'd, that it is a Fine and Stately Place, and its Port, or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour very Famous; but of difficult Acceſs, becauſe the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſtula</hi> divides it ſelf into ſeveral Branches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it diſcharges it ſelf into the Sea; and that Branch which goes to <hi>Dantzic</hi> is one of the leaſt
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63304:56"/>of them, which is the reaſon that Great Ships have not Water enough to Anchor with their Lading thro' that Branch into the Harbour of <hi>Dantzic:</hi> Between the Mouth of the River and the Port, there lyes a Fort which is call'd the <hi>Light-houſe,</hi> becauſe there is a Beacon in it where there is a Light every Night, that the Ships which are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Harbour may diſcover it a far off.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dantzic</hi> is the Town of the Greateſt Trade in all <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> moſt of which Trafick conſiſts in Corn, as doth almoſt all the Trade of <hi>Poland:</hi> The <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zickers</hi> have ſuch a priviledge that none but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, can be allowed to buy any Corn of the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> when once it is enter'd in their <hi>Port,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vaſt Quantities are brought to them from all Parts by the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſtula;</hi> half the Revenue of the Port belong'd to the King of <hi>Poland</hi> ſince the time that King <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus</hi> oblig'd the <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zickers</hi> to grant him that Tribute, for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in propoſing ſome Provoking Conditions to him, before they would ſuffer his Deputies to come into their City.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dantzic</hi> is the Capital City of all <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> 'tis about Seven Leagues from <hi>Elbing,</hi> and Twenty Six from <hi>Thorn;</hi> 'tis well enough Fortifi'd (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Country) ſince the Irruption which the <hi>Sweedes</hi> made into <hi>Poland</hi> in the Year 1655. But there are ſome Grounds that overlook and command it on the Weſt-ſide.</p>
               <p>From this Town the <hi>Polanders</hi> draw what Goods they want of Foreign Growth and Manufacture; as Cloth, Silks, Stuffs, Leather, Paper, Sugar, Oyls, and all the Spices which they uſe in very great quantities to Seaſon their Fiſh and other Meat: I do not ſpeak of the Wines and Brandy, nor of the Salt which is brought thither from <hi>France,</hi> and worth but a Crown the French <hi>Muid</hi> or Hogſhead; becauſe as for Wine the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63304:57"/>
                  <hi>Poles</hi> like no other but that of <hi>Hungary;</hi> as for Brandy they make it at home with Corn; and as for Salt, their Countrey abounds with it. Thus the Wines, Brandy and Salt that come from <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Dantzic</hi> ſerve only for <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> however there are ſuch conſiderable quantities of other Goods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from <hi>Dantzic</hi> to <hi>Poland,</hi> and ſo great a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn made from that Kingdom thither in Corn, Money, and other Things, that, as it is the only Place from which they draw all their Neceſſaries, and to which they Trade, 'tis not in the leaſt to be admir'd how that Town is come to be ſo Rich and Conſiderable.</p>
               <p>All the <hi>Dantzickers</hi> were formerly Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks: But they Embraced the <hi>Lutheran</hi> perſwaſion in the laſt Age, as did moſt of the <hi>Northern</hi> Nations. They began to imbibe that Doctrine in the Year 1525. in the Reign of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> the firſt, who did not dare to oppoſe it, becauſe he was afraid of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging in a War with the <hi>Teutonic</hi> Knights, the Truce which he had made with them being then near expir'd. <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus</hi> having afterwards receiv'd the Homage and Oath of Fidelity to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the Republick from <hi>Albert</hi> Duke of <hi>Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> he confirm'd the people of <hi>Pruſſia</hi> in their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rights and Privileges, and gave them leave to make open profeſſion of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Belief, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the <hi>Augsburg</hi> Confeſſion.</p>
               <p>The greateſt part of the Inhabitants of <hi>Dantzic</hi> are <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and the other part <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> there being only ſome few Roman Catholiks, and Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts; for there is an entire Liberty of Conſcience, yet in ſuch a manner, that the whole Government is in the hands of the <hi>Lutherans;</hi> none of the other Sects being admitted to a ſhare. The Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks have a Church there which is a Convent of Dominican Monks, which ſerves for a Pariſh to all thoſe that reſide in the Town: The Jeſuits have
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:63304:57"/>alſo a Houſe in the Suburbs, where there is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a Nunnery. As for the <hi>Lutherans</hi> they have that Stately Church which was of Old enjoy'd by the Roman Catholicks, and which is one of the fineſt Buildings that I have ſeen in <hi>Poland.</hi> 'Tis Worthy Obſervation, that at <hi>Dantzic,</hi> even among the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> they acknowledge the Popes <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicio</hi> that reſides in <hi>Poland</hi> in ſeveral Ecleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Caſes, as for Licenſes, and Diſpenſations to Marry in a degree forbidden by the Canons.</p>
               <p>I have no more to ſay of the City of <hi>Dantzic,</hi> but only that it diſclaims the Juriſdiction of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> its Inhabitants ſaying, that it did not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> but only to the King. To vindicate that right of Exemption the <hi>Dantzickers</hi> took Arms in the Year 1576. and march'd as far as <hi>Ditſchow</hi> upon the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſtula</hi> with ſome Forces which they had rais'd, under the Command of a certain Officer call'd John of <hi>Cologn,</hi> who had before that defended <hi>Marienburg.</hi> But they were defeated by the army of <hi>Poland;</hi> howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the King afterwards forgave them, at the Intreaty of the Electors of <hi>Saxony</hi> and <hi>Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> cannot ſend any Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to foreign Princes, nor receive any from 'em without the Senates Conſent, tho' 'tis he that is to give them Audience. Neither can he leave the Kingdom upon any Account, let the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance be what it will. <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III, having heard of the death of his Father <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> ſummon'd a Diet at <hi>Warſaw</hi> in the month of <hi>May</hi> 1592, that the <hi>Republick</hi> might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the Journey, which he intended to take into <hi>Swedeland.</hi> And <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> who was choſen King of <hi>Poland</hi> in the year 1370, having a deſire to return into <hi>Hungary,</hi> was obliged to ask conſent, and to enlarge the Privileges of the Nobility that he might obtain it.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:63304:58"/>
               <p>The King of <hi>Poland</hi> has a right to judge and determine civil and criminal Caſes. The defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitive Sentences in all Juriſdictions are paſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Majority of Votes. But in crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Caſes, the King's ſingle Vote ſaves the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Life: And this, becauſe he has a right to pardon all manner of Criminals, by what Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſoever they be condemned. But 'tis other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Deciſion of thoſe affairs, that concern the Republick, which are handled in a general Diet, where all the Nobility is aſſembled by its Deputies; for then it is abſolutely neceſſary to have the unanimous Conſent of all thoſe Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, whoſe number is conſiderable, before any thing can be concluded and determined. So that as often as any one Member of the Aſſembly will not conſent, and enters his proteſtation, the Diet breaks off, and all the Deputies depart; nor can the King oblige 'em to ſtay, nor get ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Diet to aſſemble till three months after that which then broke off.</p>
               <p>But tho' a King of <hi>Poland</hi> can hardly do any thing by himſelf, yet he may take Cogniſance of the payment of the Soldiers, regulate their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and command the Army. Not but that he that is great General of it ſtill has a great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the Soldiers, as I will ſhew hereafter.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the <hi>Senate</hi> in General.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> is Compos'd of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Palatines, Caſtellans,</hi> and the <hi>Ten Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of State,</hi> whoſe Dignity Entitles them to a place in that Aſſembly: It was Inſtituted to Regulate, according to the Juſtice and Equity of the Laws, all that is Tranſacted, for the Good and Security of the <hi>State.</hi> The King Creates the Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and before he Advances them to that Honour, makes them take an Oath of Fidelity to the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: But, after they are once admitted into that Body, they cannot be afterwards diſplac'd. In the General Diet they ſit at the Right and Left hand of the King, according to their Dignity, and not according to the Seniority of their Reception. 'Tis they, who, with the King, Approve and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie all the Conſtitutions which the Nobility propoſe to them by their Deputies. So that the Senators are, as it were, Mediators betwixt the King and the Nobility, to preſerve and defend the Authority of the Republick. For, 'tis in this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the Authority is properly lodg'd, not by reaſon of the great Number of Perſons of which it is Compoſed, but by a Power they derive from the Laws, which determine their reſpective Duties and Privileges.</p>
               <p>The Senators value their Dignity ſo much, that they deſpiſe all the Titles of Honour which the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours are wont to beſtow. Thus when <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and his Brother <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Hungary</hi> went to <hi>Vienna,</hi> the Emperour offer'd to confer upon the Senators, who accompany'd them, the Title of <hi>Princes of the Empire,</hi> which they refus'd
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63304:59"/>to accept of, ſaying, <q>That ſince they were Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Poland,</hi> and had Power to Treat with their King, both of Peace and War, he did them an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to think, that the Title of Prince of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire could either be more honourable or great than that of Senatour of the Republick of <hi>Poland.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Senators Swear to maintain the Rights, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Privileges of the Republick againſt all oppoſition: So that if the King ſhould attempt to extend his Power beyond the Laws and Liberties, which he is obliged by Oath to preſerve, the Senators may put him in mind of his Duty and Oath, without loſing that reſpect which is due to His Majeſty. And therefore there ought always to be Four Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors at Court, both to aſſiſt the King with their Counſel, and to ſee that nothing be done contrary to their Privileges, which the <hi>Polanders</hi> believe to be the only way to ſecure the Liberty of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick. 'Tis alſo to be obſerved, that none of the Senators muſt go out of the Kingdom without leave obtain'd of the Republick, not even for change of Air, or to drink the Waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their Health.</p>

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63304:59"/>when they become vacant, there are always a conſiderable number of Competitors, who ſolicit the King for thoſe Titles, that they may have a place in the <hi>Senate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Gneſna</hi> is Apoſtolical Legat by his Office, the firſt of all the Biſhops and Senators, and Primate of the Kingdom. Theſe Privileges were annex'd to this See by the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> whither he, who was then Archbiſhop, was ſent by King <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus Jagellon,</hi> to aſſert his Right to <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> againſt the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Knights. For that Prelate being inform'd, that, during his Abſence, the King had Married <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Daughter to the <hi>Palatine</hi> of <hi>Sandomir, Anno</hi> 1416. and cauſed her to be Crown'd at <hi>Cracow</hi> by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold;</hi> and fearing leſt he and his Succeſſors ſhou'd be depriv'd of the Privilege of Crowning the King, prevail'd with the Council to Declare and Ordain, that the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna</hi> ſhould from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth be Primate of the Kingdom. And 'tis for this reaſon that an Appeal may be brought before him, not only from the reſt of the Biſhops, but alſo from the Archbiſhop of <hi>Leopold.</hi> Afterwards, in the Year 1513. <hi>John Laski</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> being ſent to <hi>Rome</hi> by King <hi>Sigiſmund,</hi> to aſſiſt at the Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> obtained of <hi>Leo the Xth,</hi> for himſelf, and all his Succeſſors, the Quality of <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus natus,</hi> of the Holy Apoſtolick See.</p>
               <p>The Authority of this Prelate is ſo great, that 'tis not lawful to draw a Sword, or ſo much as to ſpeak indecently in his preſence. Beſides, when the King acts contrary to the Laws, the <hi>Archbiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               <p>The <hi>Croſs</hi> is carried before him when he goes to the King, or to the <hi>Diet,</hi> and when he ſits, on Almoner holds it behind his Chair. And as a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63304:60"/>farther Mark of his Grandeur, he hath a <hi>Senator</hi> and <hi>Caſtellan</hi> of the Kingdom for his Marſhal, who rides before his Coach, bearing his Staff upright, which he never bows but before the King; and when the other Marſhalls are abſent, he has the Privilege to carry the Staff upright before His Majeſty, and to March before Him to Church, or to the <hi>Diet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> comes to the Foot of the Stairs of the King's Palace, he ſtops there, till the King ſend the Chamberlain of the Crown, or ſome other of the Principal Officers of his Court to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute him. The Sub-Marſhal attends him at the top of the Stairs; and when he enters the Anti-Chamber, the King comes out of his Chamber to meet him. He never makes a Viſit but to the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Nuncio, whom he only Viſits once, not even to the Ambaſſadours of Crown'd Heads, who have viſited him. 'Tis he, who, during the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> is the Head and Regent of the Republick; and who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulates the Sentiments of all the Noblemen, who are Aſſembled, by their Deputies, in the <hi>Diet</hi> of the Election. 'Tis he who ſends Circular Letters to all the Orders of the Republick, to give them notice of the King's Death, that they may hold their Petty <hi>Diets,</hi> and to acquaint them with the time of the General <hi>Diet.</hi> And when any extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Affair happens during the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> ſome Noblemen and Senators are choſen to aſſiſt him with their Counſel in ſo difficult a Juncture.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polanders</hi> have lodg'd ſo great an Authority in the Perſon of this Prelate, becauſe they durſt not entruſt a Lay-man with it, leaſt his Ambition ſhould prompt him to aſpire to the Crown. For 'tis he who Proclaims the New King after he is Choſen; which is ſo great and ſo conſiderable a Privilege, that the Ambaſſadours of the Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates look upon the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Gneſna</hi> as the Perſon on whom the ſucceſs of their Negotiation
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63304:60"/>depends, and leave no means unattempted to gain his Favour, becauſe the King cannot be duly Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unleſs he be afterwards Proclaim'd. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this, I ſhall relate what happen'd at the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the late King <hi>John the Third,</hi> in the Year 1674. One <hi>Czartoreski,</hi> of the Faction of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> an Inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friend of Chancellour <hi>Putz,</hi> and conſequently a great Enemy to the <hi>French</hi> Faction, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>Sobieski,</hi> who was Choſen King, was then <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop</hi> of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> and in that Quality had the Power of Proclaiming the King. He would never have been prevaild with to Proclaim the Great Marſhal; but dying Three days before the Election, the right of Proclamation was devolv'd upon <hi>Trzebicki</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cracow,</hi> who being a Friend to the Marſhal <hi>Sobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eski,</hi> Proclaim'd him with Joy.</p>
               <p>There are but 16 <hi>Biſhopricks</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> as I have already obſerv'd; but they are generally of a vaſt extent, and Endow'd with great Revenues; which may be eaſily believ'd, if we conſider that that Kidgdom, after all its Loſſes, is ſtill as large as <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is the <hi>Archbiſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> in Lower <hi>Poland,</hi> in the <hi>Palatinate</hi> of <hi>Kaliſch,</hi> about 9 Leagues from that City, towards the North. This place which was once the Capital City of the Kingdom, is now only a great Unwall'd Village, without the conveniency of a River.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is the <hi>Archbiſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Leopold,</hi> which is the Metropolis of <hi>Black Ruſſia,</hi> and took its Name from <hi>Leo,</hi> Duke of that Province, who, as he was Ravaging <hi>Poland</hi> with an Army of <hi>Tartars</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> was entirely defeated by the <hi>Caſtellan</hi> of <hi>Cracow,</hi> Ann. 1279, in the Reign of <hi>Lesko the Black.</hi> This City is ſeated at the foot of the Mountains, very meanly Fortify'd, without a River, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended only by an inconſiderable Caſtle upon an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence.

               <p>This City is the Seat of 3 Biſhops, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Latin</hi> Catholick <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> an <hi>Armenian</hi> Catholick <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop,</hi> and a <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Sciſmatical <hi>Greek, Biſhop.</hi> The firſt <hi>Latin Archbiſhop</hi> was a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentleman, called <hi>Chriſtinus,</hi> who was Conſecrated by the <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>Gneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I ſhall ſay nothing of the <hi>Archbiſhops,</hi> ſince they differ not from other Catholicks; only the <hi>Armeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> have their particular Ornaments and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and the Men are ſeparated from the Women in the Church. But I ſhall take this occaſion to give a brief account of the peculiar Rites and Cuſtoms of the <hi>Ruſſians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their Biſhop is always an Unmarry'd Perſon, becauſe he is choſen among the <hi>Monks</hi> of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> who are under the Vow of Chaſtity. As for the <hi>Curats</hi> of their Pariſhes, thoſe who are admitted to Orders after their Marriage, are not oblig'd to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from their Wives. But they cannot Marry after their Ordination, and when their Wives die, they muſt for ever afterwards live in Celibacy. Their Liturgy is in the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Language, which, as well as the <hi>Poliſh,</hi> is properly a Dialect of the <hi>Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>ouie.</hi> They believe that the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> proceeds from the <hi>Father</hi> by the <hi>Son;</hi> and that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not the Head of the whole Church, but only the firſt of the Two <hi>Patriarchs;</hi> and that he of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe Authority they acknowledge, is the Second, and yet Independant on the firſt. In all other Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63304:61"/>of Faith they agree with the Catholicks: But their Ceremonies and Ornaments are different from thoſe of the <hi>Latins</hi> and <hi>Armenians;</hi> They Pray ſtanding, and make a great number of Genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions, which they reckon with Beads. They Adminiſter the Sacrament in both kinds after this manner. The <hi>Prieſt</hi> Conſecrates ſeveral little Loaves of Leaven'd Bread, and after he has taken the Sacrament himſelf, he breaks theſe Loaves into little pieces, and puts them into the Chalice with the Conſecrated Wine. Then with a little Silver Spoon, which ſerves only for that Uſe, he takes one of thoſe pieces, with a little Wine, out of the Chalice, and gives the Sacrament to thoſe who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach him, by pouring that little piece of Bread, with the Conſecrated Wine, into the Mouth of each Communicant. They Communicate ſtanding, holding their Arms a-croſs their Breaſts, and alſo make their little Children receive the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. After all the People have Communicated, the <hi>Prieſt</hi> conſumes all that is left in the Chalice.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Third</hi> Biſhoprick is that of <hi>Cracow,</hi> which is the Capital City of the Kingdom, ſcituated upon the <hi>Viſtula,</hi> in the Upper, or Little <hi>Poland.</hi> This Biſhoprick was heretofore an <hi>Archbiſhoprick,</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Mieceſlaus</hi> in the Year 964. immediately after he had imbraced the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> But that Dignity was loſt by one <hi>Lampert,</hi> who being of a Potent Family, neglected to ſend to <hi>Rome</hi> for the <hi>Pallium.</hi> 'Tis obſervable, that ſeveral Prelates have held both this Biſhoprick and the <hi>Archbiſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Gneſna</hi> at the ſame time. The Biſhop of <hi>Cracow</hi> ſtiles himſelf Duke of <hi>Siberia.</hi> All the Nobility of that Dutchy are under his Authority, and are exempted from the Juriſdiction of the Royal Coarts.</p>

There is a Lake in the Deſarts, betwixt this Province and the <hi>Boryſihenes,</hi> the Water of which Congeals to <hi>Salt</hi> by the heat of the Sun; ſo that it may be broken in pieces, and carried away in Carts like Ice: but it Melts immediately with Rain.</p>
               <pb n="111" facs="tcp:63304:65"/>

               <p>Having thus given an Account of the 32 <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,</hi> 3 <hi>Caſtellans,</hi> and one <hi>Staroſta,</hi> who are Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, it may not improperly be obſerv'd, that, tho' the Quality of <hi>Caſtellan</hi> and <hi>Staroſta</hi> is inferiour to that of a <hi>Palatin,</hi> there are Four of them who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs almoſt the Firſt Ranks among the Lay-Senators. I have already intimated the Reaſon why the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellan</hi> of <hi>Cracow</hi> is the Firſt Temporal Senator: and as for the other Three, 'tis probable that this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency was granted them in Recompence of ſome Brave Actions which the <hi>Caſtellans</hi> of thoſe Cities had perform'd.</p>
               <p>The Office of a <hi>Palatin</hi> is to Lead the Troops of his <hi>Palatinate</hi> to the Army; to Preſide in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of the Nobility in his Province; to ſet a Price upon Merchandices and Commodities; to take care that the Weights and Meaſures be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and to Judge and Defend the <hi>Jews.</hi> He hath a Vice-<hi>Palatin</hi> under him, who muſt take an Oath to him, and who ought to have an Eſtate in Land, which they call <hi>Poſſeſſionatus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſtellans</hi> are the next in Dignity to the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latines,</hi> and there are two ſorts of them in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who are uſually diſtinguiſh'd by the Titles of Great <hi>Caſtellans,</hi> and Petty, or Sub-<hi>Caſtellans.</hi> The number of the former, both in the Kingdom and Dutchy amounts to 32, and that of the latter to 49. 'Twou'd be equally tedious and unprofitable
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63304:66"/>to give a particular account of 'em all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall content my ſelf with obſerving in the general, that they are all Senators, Lieutenants, or Deputies of the <hi>Palatines</hi> and Heads of the Nobility in their reſpective Juriſdictions.</p>
               <p>In the next place I ſhall proceed to mention the Officers of State, who are Senatours; The <hi>Firſt</hi> is the Great Marſhal of the Kingdom; The <hi>Second,</hi> The Great Marſhal of the Dutchy. The <hi>Third,</hi> The Chancellour of the Kingdom. The <hi>Fourth,</hi> The Chancellour of the Dutchy. The <hi>Fifth,</hi> The Vice-Chancellor of the Kingdom. The <hi>Sixth,</hi> The Vice-Chancellour of the Dutchy. The <hi>Seventh,</hi> The Treaſurer of the Kingdom. The <hi>Eighth,</hi> The Treaſurer of the Dutchy. The <hi>Ninth,</hi> The Sub-Marſhal, or Marſhal of the Court of the Kingdom: And the <hi>Tenth,</hi> The Sub-Marſhal, or Marſhal of the Court of the Dutchy. Theſe are all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Poliſh SENATE.</hi> I have in another place given a ſufficient Account of the Privileges and Functions of the Officers mention'd here; and therefore I ſhall conclude this Chapter with obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that beſides the Four Senatours, who ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to attend the King, and to aſſiſt him with their Counſel in all Deliberations and Judgments; all the other Senatours who are at Court have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the privilege to aſſiſt in ſuch caſes. And all thoſe who are preſent in Council, and Conſent to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, or Sentence, are obliged to Sign it, not only in Criminal, but alſo in Civil Caſes, that they may afterwards be accountable for their Proceedings to the Whole Body of the Republick.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Order of the Nobility or Gentry.</head>
               <p>THE Third Order of the Republic of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> is that of the Nobility, who are only capable of poſſeſſing all the Offices and Lands both in the Dutchy and Kingdom. For all the Peaſants are Slaves, and the Burghers of Towns and Cities are only lookt upon as Tradeſmen, who can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs at moſt but ſome Houſes in the Cities, and the Lands about a League round them. As for Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, how Noble ſoever they may be in their own Country, and whatever Services they have done in the Army, to the Republick, they can neither poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs an Eſtate, nor riſe to any higher Preferment than the Command of a Regiment of Foot, or at moſt, the Place of a Major-General, which is an Office not much different from that of a Brigadeer in <hi>France;</hi> for the <hi>Polanders</hi> will never ſuffer, that a Stranger, tho' never ſo expert in War, ſhould have the general Command of their Army.</p>
               <p>The Nobility, or Gentry, are the Guardians of the Laws and Liberties of the Republic, and the Electors of their Soveraign. They beſtow the Crown and Scepter upon him, and furniſh him with Miniſters and Counſellors: They make their own Laws, and determine both their Duties and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. They are oblig'd to defend the Rights of their Countrey againſt the Incroachments of any aſpiring Prince, whoſe Ambition might carry his Deſigns beyond the limits preſcrib'd to him by the Laws.</p>
               <p>Since the number of the Gentry is ſo great, that they cannot all aſſiſt at the General Dyets, they chuſe Deputies in the Petty Dyets, whom they ſend to the General Dyets, to preſerve their Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63304:67"/>Privileges and Conſtitutions, and to contrive and Enact new Laws for their Security.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentry are generally perſwaded, that 'tis their Intereſt to preſerve an Uninterrupted Peace with their Neighbours, that they may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to preſerve all their Provinces: But 'tis plain from the Event, that they are extreamly miſtaken in their Politics; for <hi>Poland</hi> lying open on all ſides, and being ſurrounded by ſo many Enemies, we may eaſily ſuppoſe, that every one of them may find an opportunity to ſurprize ſome part of the Kingdom, before the People can put themſelves in a poſture of Defence. All that the King can do in ſuch a juncture, is to ſummon the Nobility toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to oppoſe the Enemy, which is the ſame with the <hi>Arriere Ban</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and is called the <hi>Poſtpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite</hi> in <hi>Poland.</hi> Upon ſuch occaſions 'tis to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that the King muſt ſend His Circular Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thrice into each <hi>Palatinate</hi> to Aſſemble them; That none are exempted from the Service but the Chancellour, and the <hi>Staroſta's</hi> of Frontier Places; That the Nobility of <hi>Poland</hi> are not oblig'd to go above Three Leagues out of the Kingdom, That thoſe of <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>Pruſſia</hi> are not oblig'd to go out of the Kingdom at all; That the King cannot keep the Gentry in Arms above the ſpace of Six weeks; and that all the Courts of Juſtice are ſhut up during the time that the <hi>Arriere Ban</hi> is Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.</p>
               <p>It is ſo far from being the Intereſt of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick to maintain a conſtant Peace with their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, that 'twas this very Maxim which occaſion'd the loſs of the Third part of their Country. For in the Reign of <hi>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63304:67"/>in a War with the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> and even with the <hi>Turks</hi> themſelves; and, at laſt, made them loſe all <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> and the Dutchies of <hi>Smolensko</hi> and <hi>Siberia.</hi> 'Twas their real Intereſt, not only to ſuffer the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> to make perpetual In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſions upon the <hi>Turks,</hi> but even to aſſiſt them in their Expeditions: For, by this means, they might have kept the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> who had ſerv'd 'em ſo well in the War againſt <hi>Oſman,</hi> in ſubjection to them; and conſequently the <hi>Polanders</hi> might have been ſtill Maſters of ſo many Fine Provinces which they have loſt.</p>
               <p>When all the Nobility of <hi>Poland</hi> are Aſſembled together, they make a very Conſiderable Body, and not one of their Neighbours could reſiſt them, if they knew their own ſtrength, and could ſubmit to Regular Diſcipline, and to the Command of a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral. But beſides, that it is the Intereſt of the King, never to Aſſemble ſo great and ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Body: The <hi>Polanders</hi> have alſo this Privilege, that they cannot be kept together above Six Weeks. So that if during that time the King cannot bring them to a Battle with their Enemies, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn home without asking his leave. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, if their Enemies have never ſo little Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in the Art of War, they may ſafely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the time, or retire, till the Impetuous Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent is over, and afterwards renew the Aſſault without fear, and with a certain proſpect of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
               <p>That 'tis not the Intereſt of a King of <hi>Poland,</hi> to Aſſemble the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility in one place, may be evidently demonſtrated by the following In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; When <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> II. Summon'd them to appear near <hi>Leopold,</hi> to oppoſe the <hi>Molda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians,</hi> they were juſt ready to Revolt againſt him; the Senators complaining, that their Privileges had been violated, and refuſing to March againſt
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63304:68"/>the Enemy, till they were re-eſtabliſh'd. This Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample alone, which might be confirm'd by many others, is a convincing Proof, that the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the Nobility is both a dangerous and ineffectual Remedy againſt the Diſtempers of the State.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility have another Privilege, which appears unjuſt, or at leaſt ſeems to incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their Inſolence; for a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentleman can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Arreſted for any Crime whatſoever, unleſs he be firſt Convicted by Juſtice, <hi>Niſi Jure Victus.</hi> So that he muſt be firſt Cited to appear at the Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, where he is to be Tryed; if he do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, he muſt be declar'd Contumacious; and if he appears, and is Convicted, he is Arreſted and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon'd, in order to be afterwards Indged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Laws and the Heinouſneſs of his Crime; ſo that it may be reaſonably ſuppos'd, that he who knows himſelf Guilty, and fears to be Caſt, will not run the hazard of being Convicted, but will rather chooſe to ſuffer himſelf to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd for Contumacy, than to venture the loſing of his Head.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, there are ſome Examples, which ſeem to contradict this Privilege, that a Gentleman cannot be Arreſted <hi>Niſi Jure Victus,</hi> and I my ſelf have ſeen an Inſtance of it in the Perſons of thoſe who Aſſaſſinated <hi>Gonczenski,</hi> the Petty General of the Army of <hi>Lithuania.</hi> The Criminals were, without any Formality, carry'd Priſoners to <hi>Elbing,</hi> and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Condemn'd by the General Diet held at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> in the Year 1654, to be Beheaded in the Market-place. But it muſt be confeſs'd, that their Crime was ſo Enormous; that, in ſuch a caſe, the Nobility could not, in Juſtice, refuſe to wave their Privilege. For thoſe Wretches took that Gentleman in the Night-time out of his Bed from his Wife, at <hi>Vitna,</hi> and having put him in a Coach
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63304:68"/>with a Confeſſor, whom they brought along with them, they carry'd him out of the City, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd him immediately to make his Confeſſion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they Shot him dead.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen have another Privilege, That no Soldier, or Officer of the Army can be Quarter'd upon them; and any Officer who ſhould attempt to do it, would be Cited before the firſt General <hi>Dyet,</hi> where he would be Condemned to Death, or Mark'd with Infamy; that is, the Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wou'd be declared uncapable of having a Vote, or of poſſeſſing any Office or Employment. An Example of which I ſhall relate, which happen'd at <hi>Warſaw, May</hi> 17. 1674, in the <hi>Dyet</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>John the IIId.</hi> and which contributed not a little to his Election. The Son of the <hi>Palatin</hi> of <hi>Smolensko</hi> went to Lodge in the Houſe of <hi>Vicz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowieski,</hi> by the Order, as 'twas given out, of the Great General <hi>Patz, Palatin</hi> of <hi>Vilna.</hi> The <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals,</hi> who are Judges of thoſe Enormities, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned that <hi>Palatin</hi> to the Puniſhment preſcrib'd be the Laws, Two days before the Concluſion of the <hi>Dyet:</hi> Thus he was deprived of a Right to Vote, which was a very conſiderable Mortification to Chancellour <hi>Patz</hi> his Couſin, who plac'd a great deal of Conſidence in him, as a declar'd Enemy to the Marſhal <hi>Sobieski;</hi> and all the <hi>French</hi> Party, and conſequently a zealous Promoter of the Faction of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Auſtria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Conſtitution that ſecures the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentry from being Arreſted till they be Legally Convicted, is certainly a Grievance to the Nation, and ſeems to ſubvert the Common Maxims of Juſtice: but they have another Privilege that is equally deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive of Civil Society, and inconſiſtent with the Principles of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> For every Gentleman in <hi>Poland,</hi> is by Law, the Abſolute and Deſpotic Maſter of the Peaſants that live in his
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:63304:69"/>Territories, and may put 'em to Death when he pleaſes. When a Stranger is ſurpriz'd at ſuch a Heatheniſh Cuſtom, and takes the Liberty to Ask 'em, How <hi>Chriſtians</hi> can aſſume a Privilege ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Spirit of their Religion? And how the Law, which is a Gift of God, can eſtabliſh a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſo oppoſite to the Laws of God himſelf? They uſually Reply, <q>That tho' they have ſuch a Power, they never make uſe of it, no more than we and other <hi>Chriſtians</hi> uſe the power we have to kill our Horſes: Adding, That the Peaſants ſerve 'em in ſtead of Beaſts.</q> But beſides that the Compariſon is not very Human, and much leſs Chriſtian; it happens ſometimes that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men kill their Peaſants, either when they are Drunk, or Irritated by ſome Brutal Paſſion, to which young Men are oftentimes ſubject. For the Wives and Daughters of theſe miſerable Wretches are Forc'd, and Carry'd away, without daring to reſiſt their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent Raviſhers; and this is ſo common among the Perſants, that few of 'em ſcruple to chuſe a Bride that has loſt her Virginity.</p>

So
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63304:69"/>that the Office of Great Secretary, is, as it were, a ſtep, by which they may riſe to that of Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; and both thoſe Officers muſt be Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks.</p>
               <p>Next to the Great Secretaries are the Referen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of the Crown and Dutchy; there are Two of them in each State, one a Lay-man, and the other an <hi>Eccleſiaſtick.</hi> They preſent Petitions to the King, and return His Majeſty's Anſwer: And tho' they are not Members of the <hi>Senate,</hi> they have a Privilege to ſit by the <hi>Senators</hi> in Judgements of Proceſſes upon Information, to give their Advice, and afterwards to Pronounce the Sentence that is given. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that all the Judges, and Officers of Juſtice, all the Advocates, Proctors, Regiſters and Notaries, wear a <hi>Sabre,</hi> or <hi>Scimitar</hi> by their ſide, and do not lay it aſide, either when they Judge, or Plead a Cauſe, and that they have no other Garb than what they uſually wear.</p>
               <p>There are Four General Officers of the Army in <hi>Poland,</hi> 2 for the Crown, and 2 for <hi>Lithuania, viz.</hi> A Great General, and a Petty, or Lieutenant-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. Thoſe Generals of the Army have no Place in the <hi>Senate,</hi> unleſs they be <hi>Palatines,</hi> or <hi>Caſtellans;</hi> or be poſſeſt of ſome of thoſe Offices which Entitle 'em to a Place in the <hi>Senate.</hi> The Great General Commands the Whole Army, and has Power to Quarter the Troops where he pleaſes, the King himſelf not being able to hinder him: And this Power is ſo conſiderable, that it makes a Great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral formidable to all the Nobility.</p>
               <p>His Office is to take care that the Soldiers which are Levy'd for the Service of the Republick, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit no Diſorders; that the Members of the <hi>Diets</hi> may not be over-aw'd by the Army. He Helds the Army, Orders its Encampments, puts it in Battalia, and gives the Signal of Battel, and of Retreat; he takes care of the Convoys and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitions,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:63304:70"/>ſets a Price on every thing that is Sold in the Army, Regulates the Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Puniſhes Offenders. The Office of the Petty General is to take Care of thoſe who are appointed for Guards, and of the Parties that are ſent out to diſcover the Enemy. He Commands the Foreign Troops, and even the Whole Army in the abſence of the General, and ſucceeds him in courſe upon the occaſion of a Vacancy.</p>
               <p>There are many other Offices in the Army, the moſt conſiderable of which, is that of the Great Standard-bearer; and the next, that of Great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Artillery.

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63304:70"/>is, by the Death of the King; whoſe Body is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately laid upon a Bed of State, and ſome Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, both <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> and <hi>Secular,</hi> are choſen to attend him. In the mean time the Republick Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders all the Neceſſary Expences for the Ceremony to be taken out of the Treaſures left by the Decea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed King.</p>
               <p>The ſame Honours are alſo given to the Queens after their Deceaſe, as I had occaſion to obſerve at the Death of Queen <hi>Mary Louiſe,</hi> who dy'd at <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, May</hi> 10. 1667. in the Palace which King <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> her Husband, had in the Suburbs. The next day She was carry'd to the Caſtle, where She was expos'd on a Bed of State, till She was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd to <hi>Cracow</hi> to be Interr'd. She Dy'd about the end of a <hi>Diet,</hi> and almoſt ſuddenly, of a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxion upon Her Lungs, occaſion'd by a too long, and earneſt Diſpute with General <hi>Patz,</hi> about an Affair She had propos'd to him, which he would not conſent to. For that Princeſs was ſo fond of Intriguing, and ſo deſirous to Govern the State a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, that She was, in a manner, Jealous of the King her Husband, who durſt not ſpeak to any Woman in private, leaſt ſhe ſhou'd imagine that he was Govern'd by another. This troubleſome Conſtraint made him ſo uneaſie, that he was not much afflicted at Her Death; for, the ſame Night he return'd from the <hi>Diet</hi> to the Palace, to ſee a Perſon whom He had Lov'd before, but durſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver entertain during the Queens Life.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Interregnum</hi> may alſo happen by a Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Abdication, when a King freely Reſigns the Crown into the Hands of the Republick: But, 'tis very rare to ſee a King Deſcend Voluntarily from the Throne, and few will imitate the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of King <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> who, after he had Reign'd Twenty years, with the Love of all the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, made a Publick Reſignation in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63304:71"/>at <hi>Warſaw, Septemb.</hi> 16. 1668. Notwithſtanding the Earneſt Solicitations of the Whole <hi>Senate,</hi> and of all the Nobility to make Him alter His Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Tears that were ſhed by all the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, at the Sight of ſo Diſmal a Revolution. For he was ſo Univerſally Belov'd by the Nobility and <hi>Senate,</hi> that they voluntarily Aſſign'd Him a Year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Penſion of 50000 Crowns, as a Teſtimony of their Acknowledgment towards a Prince who had Govern'd them ſo well. Nevertheleſs that Penſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was never Paid, tho it was afterwards Inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> which King <hi>Michael</hi> Swore to obſerve after His Election. The Abdicated King went to <hi>France,</hi> where he died at <hi>Nevers, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 16. 1672. I cannot, on this occaſion, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear taking notice of an odd Circumſtance in the Fate of that Prince and His Queen: for the latter quitted <hi>France</hi> and went to <hi>Poland,</hi> where She dy'd in Her Husband's City: and the former left <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and went to <hi>France,</hi> where he dy'd in His Wive's City.</p>
               <p>Innovation are always dangerous to a State, and threaten it with ſome Fatal Revolution; which the <hi>Polanders</hi> conſidering, endeavour'd to prevent the conſequences of ſo unuſual an Action, cauſing an Article to be Inſerted into the <hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> which they made King <hi>Michael</hi> Swear to obſerve, That never any King ſhould be ſuffered to Abdicate for the future; but that Article was left out in the <hi>Pacta</hi> which King <hi>John</hi> the IIId Swore after his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, in the Church of St. <hi>John</hi> at <hi>Warſaw, June</hi> 5. 1674.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Interregnum</hi> may be alſo occaſion'd, by the Depoſing of a Prince, either for <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Notorious Crime, as in the Caſe of <hi>Locticus,</hi> who was Depos'd for his exceſſive Debauchery, and Succeeded by <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Bobemia,</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen King of <hi>Poland</hi> in the Year 1300. But thoſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63304:71"/>Inſtances are very rare, as well as the Examples of a Prince's Flying from His Kingdom, like <hi>Henry</hi> II. King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and III. of <hi>France;</hi> who, having receiv'd Advice of the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>IXth</hi> His Brother, by a Courier that was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd to Him by the Queen His Mother, ſecretly departed from <hi>Cracow,</hi> after he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd the Crown of <hi>Poland</hi> Five Months, with the Love of all the Nobility; who were ſo troubl'd at His Flight, and the loſs of ſo good a Prince, that they Wrote on the <hi>12th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1574. a very Preſſing and Reſpectful Letter to perſwade Him to Return.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polanders</hi> look upon the <hi>Interregnums</hi> as the moſt Favourable Occaſions to confider of the Sureſt and Moſt Effectual Ways to Preſerve their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: and though the Royal Authority is then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Lodg'd in the <hi>Senate,</hi> 'tis in ſome meaſure Repreſented by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> as Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the Kingdom, and the Firſt of all the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators,</hi> as I intimated before.</p>
               <p>During the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> ſome of the Senators and Noblemen are ſent to the Generals of the Army, to ſtay with them, and to aſſiſt them with their Advice in Matters relating to the War. Some Senatours are alſo Deputed to the Caſtle of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi> to Viſit the Treaſury of the Crown; and to make an Inventary of it with thoſe that have the Keys, which they preſent at the next Coronation. Commiſsioners are alſo appointed to enquire into the State of the Revenue that is ſet apart for the King's Table, and to give an Account of it to the Republick.</p>
               <p>During the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> and till the New King be Proclaim'd, the Republick pretends that all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Princes, and even Crown'd Heads them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are obliged to give them the Title of <hi>Moſt Serene.</hi> But when the King of <hi>France</hi> Writes to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63304:72"/>the Republick Aſſembl'd in a <hi>Diet</hi> of Election, he makes no mention of <hi>Serenity,</hi> and only Writes in theſe Terms. <hi>To our moſt Dear and Great Friends, Allyes and Confederates, the States of the Kingdom of</hi> Foland, <hi>and Great Dutchy of</hi> Lithuania. Nor is it reaſonable that a King of <hi>France</hi> ſhould give the Republick of <hi>Poland</hi> the Title of <hi>Moſt Serene,</hi> ſince they do not give their own King, either the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Moſt Serene,</hi> or of <hi>Majeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall only obſerve further on this Subject, that as ſoon as the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna</hi> has Notify'd, by his Circular Letters, that the King is Dead, all the Courts of Juſtice are ſhut up, and are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd again till after the Coronation of the New Elected King, except the Marſhal's Court, which continues open; and another, which is eſtabliſh'd for deciding Controverſies that may happen du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>Diet</hi> of the Election. But as for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cauſes, and private Law-Suits, they are not Try'd till after the King's Coronation.</p>

               <p>Before the Ambaſſadours come to <hi>Warſaw,</hi> they are to Notifie their Arrival to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> who appoints Lodgings for 'em at ſome diſtance from the City, and ſends a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to each of 'em, to obſerve their Actions, and to hinder them from making Parties: But thoſe Rules are ſeldom put in Execution; for the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours of Princes live openly at <hi>Warſaw;</hi> 'tis true, there is a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentleman appointed to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend every one of 'em during the <hi>Diet,</hi> that the Republick may be inform'd of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and that they may not have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to Bribe, or Corrupt the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But this is an Inconveniency that cannot be avoided by all theſe Precations; for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63304:73"/>of Money is ſo reigning a Vice in <hi>Poland,</hi> and attended with ſo little Scandal and Infamy, that the Fidelity which a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentleman owes to his Country, would not be Proof againſt 1000 Crowns.</p>
               <p>'Tis the Intereſt of the Ambaſſadours to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage all the Senators, and the whole Order of the Nobility, ſince the diſobliging of one of them may render 'em incapable of Compaſsing their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Thus the Quarrelling with Chancellour <hi>Patz</hi> in the <hi>Diet</hi> of the Election, <hi>Anno</hi> 1668. was the true reaſon why the Duke of <hi>Newburg</hi> was Exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and <hi>Michael Vicznowieski</hi> was Elected King. In the mean time it muſt be acknowledg'd, that the Election was Tumultuary; that the Nobility had not a Free Vote; and that they were in a manner hurry'd away by the Violence of the Multitude, which was ſo great, that <hi>Praſmowski</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> was forc'd to Proclaim Him, which he was unwilling to do, becauſe he was ſenſible of the Dangers that threatn'd the Republick in that Juncture, and of the great need they had of a Rich and Valiant Prince. At the ſame time he knew, that King <hi>Michael</hi> wanted both thoſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; For he was ſo poor, that during the Life of Queen <hi>Mary Louiſe,</hi> he had nothing to ſubſiſt upon, as I intimated before, but a Penſion which She allow'd him of 6000 Livres a Year. And as for his Courage, it may be gueſs'd at by what happen'd immediately after his Election, when he durſt not reſent the Affront he receiv'd from the Marquiſs of <hi>Brandenburg;</hi> who, without asking his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, caus'd a <hi>Pruſſian</hi> Gentleman, who had fled to <hi>Poland</hi> for Protection, to be ſeiz'd and carryd away before the King's eyes, and almoſt under the Windows of His Palace.</p>
               <p>'Tis plain then, that the <hi>Polanders</hi> ought to have Choſen a Prince that was equally Brave and Rich,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:63304:73"/>and able to Support their Tottering State. For if they had conſider'd their true Intereſt, in the choice of a Soveraign, the <hi>Turks</hi> wou'd never have had the boldneſs to Attack <hi>Poland,</hi> as they did in the Reign of King <hi>Michael,</hi> where they enter'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania</hi> with a Powerful Army, and eaſily made themſelves Maſters of <hi>Caminieck,</hi> which the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> could never retake ſince.</p>
               <p>But as <hi>Poland</hi> could not chooſe a poorer, ſo they could not have Choſen a more liberal Prince than King <hi>Michael.</hi> And as he was wholly deſtitute of the means to diſplay that Noble and Princely Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſo Providence order'd, that as ſoon as he was Proclaim'd King, he found himſelf Maſter of richer Furniture, and a greater quantity of Plate than any of the Kings His Predeceſſours had ever enjoy'd. For all the Senatours and Gentlemen, who were able to make any conſiderable Preſents, ſtrove, with a kind of Emulation, to expreſs their Affection to their New Soveraign; ſo that on the Day of his Election, he was ſo amaz'd at ſuch a ſudden and unexpected Alteration, that he cou'd hardly forbear looking upon it as a Golden Dream.</p>
               <p>He was no ſooner Proclaim'd, but the Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour began to Inſinuate, that He ow'd his Crown to him; nor was it a difficult task to Impoſe upon a Prince, who was eaſily Govern'd, and had more good Nature than Judgment.</p>
               <p>Thus the Chancellor had the pleaſure to ſee that his Power was as great as his Ambition, but that ſatisfaction was ſufficiently moderated by the Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Diviſions that happen'd under his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry; for having perſwaded the King, without the conſent of the Republick, to Marry the Emperor's Siſter, by whom he had no Children. There was ſuch a conſiderable Party form'd againſt that Prince, that he was in perpetual danger of being Dethron'd, and reduc'd in a Cloiſter, to greater
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63304:74"/>Miſeries, than that which he ſuffer'd before his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. And, to heighten His Aſſlictions, he perceiv'd that Queen <hi>Eleanor</hi> his Wife was engag'd in the Party that wou'd have oblig'd him to Reſign His Crown, that ſhe might Marry a handſom and brave Prince, whoſe Picture ſhe had ſeen, and who, without doubt, had been King of <hi>Poland,</hi> if Death, jealous of the happineſs of that Country, had not ſnatch'd him away in the flower of his Age, to the regret of all the World, and particularly of Q. <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anor,</hi> who cou'd not forbear expreſſing her ſorrow by her Tears when ſhe heard the News of his death.</p>
               <p>Among the ſeveral Princes who pretended to diſpoſſeſs King <hi>Michael,</hi> Duke <hi>Auguſtus, Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oſnabrug,</hi> who would have willingly exchang'd both his Biſhoprick and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, for the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> was one: But he was Marry'd, he would have met with greater obſtacles than the Prince I juſt nown mention'd.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the <hi>Diets</hi> in general.</head>
               <p>THo' as a mark of the Obedience and Reſpect, which Chriſtians are oblig'd to pay to the Clergy, the <hi>Polanders</hi> have thought fit to give the Biſhops the Precedency in their <hi>Diets,</hi> as being the Miniſters and Diſpenſers of Holy Things; it hath been ſometimes obſerv'd, that the Laity have taken the liberty to diſpute that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour with them. Thus at the <hi>Diet</hi> held at <hi>Lub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin,</hi> 1501. under the Reign of <hi>Alexander</hi> the II. there happen'd a great conteſt betwixt the Biſhops and the Temporal Senators; for tho' the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter were willing that the Biſhops ſhould be Seated all in a Row on the King's Right hand, they deſir'd
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:63304:74"/>that they might alſo ſit in a Row on his Left hand, that ſo they might not be altogether beneath them. This Controverſy was long and hotly agitated; but, at laſt, the King decided it in favour of the Biſhops, declaring, That they ſhould ſtill enjoy their Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Priviledge, to ſit next the King, both on His Right and Left hand.</p>
               <p>A General <hi>Diet</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> is a Meeting of the Nobility in one place, to Conſult about the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Republick. The King may appoint the Meeting where he thinks fit, except the <hi>Diet</hi> of the Coronation, which can only be held at <hi>Cracow;</hi> but, as for the reſt, it has been always in the King's Power to appoint the place of their Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 'Tis true, that, for ſome time, they have been always held at <hi>Warſaw;</hi> But, the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> having made a Complaint ſome years ago, that they were expos'd to all the Inconveniencies of a long and tedious Journey; it was agreed, that one of Three <hi>Diets</hi> ſhould, for the Conveniency of the <hi>Lithuani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> be held at <hi>Grodno,</hi> a City of <hi>Lithuania</hi> in the <hi>Palatinat</hi> of <hi>Troki,</hi> on the River <hi>Niemen,</hi> about Twenty Leagues from <hi>Vilna;</hi> 'Tis ſeated partly upon a Plain, and partly upon an Eminence, and is Defended by a Caſtle, which was taken and Sack'd by the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> in the Year 1655, when the Whole Kingdom was harraſs'd by the <hi>Swedes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Two <hi>Diets</hi> are to be held at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> which, from the Election of <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> III. to that of <hi>John</hi> III. was always the Reſidence of the Kings of <hi>Poland:</hi> It is Scituated on the <hi>Viſtula,</hi> in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Maſſovia,</hi> and the Dioceſs of <hi>Poſnania.</hi> There is a fine Palace in this City, which <hi>Sigsſmund</hi> built after his Election; but there are no Avenues to it, and the place where it is Scituated is ſo ſtraightn'd, that one muſt, in a manner, Divine, how to go into it. It has a very fine Proſpect, but is wholly deſtitute of Water, Gardens, or Trees.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63304:75"/>Nor can thoſe Defects be ſupply'd, becauſe on the one ſide it is bounded by the Houſes of the City, and, on the other by the <hi>Viſtula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Warſaw</hi> is compoſed of Two Cities joyn'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The Old Town, which is Wall'd with Brick, is ſmall, and ill Paved, as are all the Cities of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> but, to make amends 'tis Populous, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a good Trade. The New Town which is joyn'd to it, is not conſiderable. Beſides thoſe Two Cities, there is alſo the great Suburb of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi> the Houſes of which are, for the moſt part, built and cover'd with Wood, except ſome Pallaces which certain Perſons of Quality had begun to Build before the <hi>Swediſh</hi> Invaſion; both becauſe the Kings, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> and <hi>Caſimir,</hi> had a Palace there, where they uſually Reſided; and becauſe thoſe Princes deſign'd to encloſe that Suburb, and the Two Cities with 16 Baſtions, which they had already Mark'd out, and whereof ſome footſteps are yet to be ſeen. The above-mention'd Palace, where the Kings, <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> and <hi>Caſimir</hi> Reſided, has a Garden, but is deſtitute both of Water, and Trees.</p>
               <p>There is ſtill a Chapel in that Suburb, called the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> Chapel, which <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> III. built for the Burying place of a Duke of <hi>Muſcovie</hi> and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who died in Priſon at <hi>Goſtynin,</hi> in the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat</hi> of <hi>Rava,</hi> about Three Leagues from the City of <hi>Plocsko</hi> upon the <hi>Viſtula,</hi> to leave to Poſterity a Monument of his Victories over the <hi>Muſcovites.</hi> It was ſome time ago given to the <hi>Dominican Fryars,</hi> who have ſettl'd a Convent in it.</p>
               <p>'Tis the Cuſtom in <hi>Poland</hi> to hold Petty <hi>Diets</hi> in all the <hi>Palatinats,</hi> before they hold a great or General <hi>Diet.</hi> Theſe Petty <hi>Diets</hi> muſt be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd Three weeks before they can be held, and held Six weeks before the General <hi>Diets.</hi> In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their Meeting, the King ſends Circular Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63304:75"/>to Summon the Nobility, and to notify the Day of the General <hi>Diet;</hi> And in thoſe Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Letters he mentions every thing that is to be Treated of in the General <hi>Diet:</hi> All the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in <hi>Poland</hi> have the Privilege to aſſiſt at the Petty <hi>Diets,</hi> where they Chuſe their Nuncio's or Deputies, to whom they give Inſtructions, Contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all they ought to grant, or refuſe in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Diet.</hi> Thoſe Nuncio's were firſt eſtabliſh'd in the Reign of <hi>Caſimir</hi> III. who, to raiſe Money for the Payment of his Army, order'd all the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinats</hi> to ſend their Deputies to the General <hi>Diet,</hi> to find out the moſt proper Means to ſupply his Neceſſities; and, ſince that time, no General <hi>Diet</hi> can be held without Deputies from all the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The General <hi>Diets</hi> are wont to depute 16 Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who are Choſen among the <hi>Biſhops, Palatins,</hi> and <hi>Caſtellans;</hi> 4 of whom are to be always with the King, to take care that nothing be done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws: and ſince the Year 1649, they have joyned to them a Deputy of the Nobility, who is choſen by all the <hi>Palatinats.</hi> Every thing that is concluded and ordain'd by thoſe Deputies, with the King's Approbation, has the force of a Law; and if they neglect to reſide at Court, or to perform their Duty, they are Fin'd; a Lay-man in 2000 <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres,</hi> and an Eccleſiaſtick in 6000.</p>
               <p>All the General <hi>Diets</hi> are begun by the Election of a Speaker, or Marſhal of the Deputies, who muſt be Choſen out of one of the three Nations; <hi>Firſt,</hi> Among the Deputies of Upper <hi>Poland. Secondly,</hi> Among thoſe of Lower <hi>Poland:</hi> And, in the <hi>Third</hi> and laſt place, among thoſe of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> which frequently occaſions Debates that laſts for ſeveral days. The Marſhal of the Deputies being Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, the King gives him his hand to kiſs, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards makes the ſame Compliment to all the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63304:76"/>Deputies: After which, the Chancellor Propoſes the Points that are to be conſider'd of in the <hi>Diet,</hi> which are always different, according to the various occaſions of the Republick: In the mean time I cannot forbear obſerving, that the <hi>Polanders</hi> ſpend more time in Drinking than in Deliberating con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Affairs; for they never enter upon Buſineſs till they begin to want Money to buy <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary</hi> Wine.</p>
               <p>After the Chancellor has, in the King's Name, propoſed to the <hi>Diets</hi> all the Articles they are to Deliberate upon, the Speaker or Marſhal of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties acquaints the King, in the Name of the Nobility, with what they deſire of him; which is to Redreſs the Grievances, and Regulate the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes committed either againſt the State, or Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons; to diſpoſe of the Royal Gifts, the Benefices and Offices that are vacant, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute them according to the Laws which forbid the beſtowing of Two of them that are Inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to one Perſon. After which, the Chancellor makes Anſwer for the King, That His Majeſty will ſatisfie 'em, after he has taken the Advice of the Senators.</p>
               <p>The Marſhal of the Deputies has a great Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them in the <hi>Diet;</hi> For 'tis he who Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes Silence, and Speaks to the King and Senate. And conſequently, ſince his Authority enables him either to Animate or Moderate their Heats, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways extreamly reſpected, and the Court is particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly kind to him. 'Tis no wonder then that there is ſo much Intriguing at his Election, and that the Conteſt is uſually ſo hot. For 'tis the buſineſs of the Court to procure a Marſhal that will promote their Deſigns in the <hi>Diet;</hi> and, on the other hand, the Deputies who choſe him, have a different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt from that of the Court, and are always a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of loſing their Liberties, or of ſeeing their
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63304:76"/>Privileges abridg'd by ſome New Laws. Thoſe different Intereſts are frequently the reaſon that there are ſome Deputies, who, regarding only their private advantage, oppoſe the Election of him whom the Court would have Choſen, that the King may Bribe them with ſome Benefice, Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Royal Gift; and there are not only Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties who make a Noiſe at the Election of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, but, during the whole Progreſs of the <hi>Diet,</hi> that they may extort Favours from the Court; Nay, there are ſome who force the King to comply with 'em, by threatning to break up the <hi>Diet,</hi> if he does not anſwer their Expectations: For there are ſo few of 'em, that have a ſincere regard to the true Intereſt of the Republick, that there is ſcarce one to be found among 'em, that is capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting the Temptation of 2000 Crowns. Thus the Court may purchaſe the Votes of the Members, or diſſolve an over-bold and obſtinate <hi>Diet,</hi> by ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering ſufficient Sums among the Mercenary Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And even not only the Neighbours, but the Enemies of the Kingdom may, by the ſame means, procure a Rupture in the <hi>Diet,</hi> when they find the honeſt Party reſolv'd to take effectual Meaſures for the ſecurity of the Republick.</p>
               <p>Before any thing can be reſolv'd in the <hi>Diet,</hi> it muſt be propos'd by the Deputies, and approv'd by the King and Senate: And before it can paſs into a Law, it muſt be revis'd by the Marſhal of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties, and two of the Deputies beſides; or elſe by three Senators and ſix Deputies: After which it muſt be read in the Senate in the King's Preſence, and the Chancellors muſt ask with a loud Voice, Whether the King, Senators and Deputies, will have the Seal put to it. Then 'tis ſeal'd and inſerted in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters of <hi>Warſaw,</hi> or in thoſe of the Chancery of the Kingdom; and one of the King's Secretary's takes care to get it Printed at the Charge of the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63304:77"/>Publick Treaſury, that it may be ſent to the Pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>Diets,</hi> and to the Courts of all the <hi>Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They Treat in all <hi>Diets,</hi> not only of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Republick, but alſo of particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Thus, in one of the <hi>Diets,</hi> they took cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of the difference betwixt the Order of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha,</hi> and Prince <hi>Demetrius Vicznowieski,</hi> who took poſſeſſion of an Eſtate which the Duke <hi>Oſtrog</hi> his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law had given to that Order. And, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Diet,</hi> thoſe who Murder'd <hi>Gonczeski,</hi> Petty General of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> were Proſecuted and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd to be Beheaded. But in caſes of Treaſon againſt the King, the <hi>Polanders</hi> pretend, that neither His Majeſty, nor the Order of the Nobility ought to be preſent at the Judging and Determining of the Cauſe; and 'twas on this ſcore, that the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal <hi>Lubomiski</hi> complain'd againſt K. <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> who caus'd him to be Condemn'd for Contumacy, in the <hi>Diet</hi> held at <hi>Warſaw, Anno</hi> 1664. Nevertheleſs, in a <hi>Diet</hi> held in the ſame City, 1582. King <hi>Steven Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri</hi> brought ſeveral Deputies into the <hi>Senate,</hi> to be preſent at the Tryal and Judgment of <hi>Sborowski,</hi> who was accus'd of Treaſon againſt the King. Which that Great Prince did, that all the Nobility might be Witneſſes of the Juſtice of his proceedings.</p>
               <p>'Tis in a General <hi>Diet</hi> that they give the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genat,</hi> that is, the Right of Nobility to Strangers, which renders 'em capable of Poſſeſſing ſome ſmall Penſions or Gifts of the Republick. That right is now given to thoſe who are in Favour at Court, or Protected by ſome Great Lord; whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly it was granted only to Officers, as a Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for their Services done to the State. Thoſe who are not Officers, and yet pretend to the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genat,</hi> by the favour of the King, or of the Marſhal of the Deputies, procuring their Names to be inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Inſtructions of the Army, that is, among
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63304:77"/>the Names of the Officers who demand to be made Gentlemen of <hi>Poland;</hi> and every one of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders gives in an account of his Genealogy, Name, Sirname, Family and Services, and puts his Coat of Armes in the middle: And after they have been receiv'd by the <hi>Diet,</hi> and their Pattents Seal'd, they take an Oath of Fidelity before the Marſhal of the Deputies, by which they Swear to be faithful to their Country, and to the King: and the Marſhal gives 'em a Certificate, declaring, that the <hi>Diet</hi> has receiv'd ſuch a one for its Natural Son, and that he has taken the Oath of Fidelity before him. Yet, tho' a ſtranger be made a Gentleman of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the King cannot beſtow any conſiderable Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or Conſiſtorial Benefices on him, or his Children, to the third Generation. For the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick has made this Proviſion, that they may be the better aſſured of the Fidelity of thoſe who are entruſted with any Office, or enjoy any Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>According to the Conſtitutions and Laws of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> a <hi>Diet</hi> muſt not ſit above Six Weeks, and the Nobility are ſo fond and jealous of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, that when the King endeavours to prolong the Seſſion of a <hi>Diet,</hi> and even when the Intereſt of the State requires the Sitting of that Aſſembly, the Deputies are always ready to oppoſe ſuch an Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and Charge their Marſhal to Acquaint the King, that they will immediately leave the <hi>Diet,</hi> as ſoon as they perceive that he intends to keep them longer than uſually: I ſhall only mention one Inſtance of this Unaccountable Obſtinacy, which happen'd in the <hi>Diet</hi> Aſſembled at the Coronation of King <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> in the Year 1649.</p>
               <p>The Defeat of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army at <hi>Pilaveze,</hi> and afterwerds the Dreadful Irruption of the <hi>Coſſacks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> into the very heart of the Kingdom, had reduc'd the Republick almoſt to the laſt extremity:
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63304:78"/>and ſince the <hi>Diet</hi> had been ſo buſy'd in determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning particular affairs, that they had not time to conſider of the Means to raiſe a ſufficient Army to oppoſe the progreſs of ſo Barbarous and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble an Enemy, till the very day before the breaking up of the <hi>Diet,</hi> the King and the Senators endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to find out a way to avoid the terrible dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that threatned 'em, and for that end reſolv'd to Prolong the <hi>Diet;</hi> But as ſoon as the Deputies were inform'd of this Reſolution, they ſent their Marſhal to the Senators, to put 'em in mind of the Law which forbids the prolonging of <hi>Diets,</hi> and afterward to take leave of the King. The Marſhal, to execute his Commiſsion, went to the Senate, and began to thank the King, and to take leave of Him in the Name of all the Nobility; whereupon the Senators riſing up, deſir'd that they wou'd condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to ſit only one day longer, repreſenting the Preſsing Exigencies of the preſent Juncture. The Chancellor ſeconded theſe Intreaties with a very Moving and Pathetick Harangue. After which the Marſhal having reſum'd his Character, which he had already laid down, went back to the Deputies, and pray'd them to give their Opinion concerning the Prolongation which the King and Senate deſir'd. The Deputies met again at the return of their Marſhal, and were, at laſt, prevail'd with, tho' not without a great deal of difficulty, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent that the <hi>Diet</hi> ſhould be prolong'd, but, upon this condition, that every one of them ſhould ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain whatever his <hi>Palatinat</hi> had charg'd him to ask.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of the <hi>Diet</hi> of the <hi>Election.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THE General <hi>Diet</hi> for the Election of a King is always held in the open Field, about half a League from <hi>Warſaw,</hi> near the Village of <hi>Vola,</hi> where they erect a ſort of Booth cover'd with Boards, at the Publick Charge, which, in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Language, is called <hi>Szopa,</hi> or a Shelter from bad Weather. This place is built and prepar'd by the Treaſurer of the Crown: 'tis ſurrounded with a Ditch, and has Three Doors. The Day appointed for the <hi>Diet</hi> being come, the Senate and the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity go to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> to hear the Maſs of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and to beg the Grace of God in order to the Electing of a New King, who may have all the Qualitys neceſſary to defend the Intereſts of the Church and of the Republick. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which they go to the <hi>Szopa,</hi> where the Order of the Nobility elects the Marſhal of the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were ſent by the Petty <hi>Diets,</hi> who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Choſen by Plurality of Voices, and having taken the Oath, goes to Salute the Senators, and to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by their Approbation.</p>
               <p>After theſe Preliminaries, the Orders of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and Nobility enter into an Union, or Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they Ratifie and Confirm with an Oath, Not to ſeparate from one another; not to Name any perſon for King; Nor acknowledge him as ſuch till he be Elected by the unanimous conſent of 'em all. They ſwear alſo to preſerve all the Rights, Privileges and Immunities of the Republick; and that he who ſhall do otherwiſe, ſhall be declar'd an enemy to his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. They Promiſe reciprocally, neither to give their
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63304:79"/>Voices for an Election, nor to enter into any Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Candidates, or their Ambaſſadors, till all the Irregularities and Diſorders that have been committed either in the Kingdom or Dutchy be conſider'd and redreſs'd. They annul and make void all the Decrees of the Tribunals, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Statutes of the Kings that are found to be contrary to their Liberties, and Promiſe to make a Law to that Purpoſe. They declare, That all the Judgements given before the Publication of the <hi>Interregnum</hi> ſhall be valid; and that they will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of all that ſhall be done by the Court of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, eſtabliſh'd during the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> which is called <hi>Kaptur,</hi> and is deſign'd for the defence of the Country, for Coyning of Money, for raiſing of Soldiers, and for maintaining the Laws. They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any perſon to come to the <hi>Diet</hi> with Strangers, or with Fire-Arms: They ordain, that the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the Army ſhall take an Oath before Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsioners, to diſcharge the Truſt that is repos'd in 'em, with all poſsible fidelity, to make no other uſe of their Troops than to oppoſe the Enemies of the Nation; To defend the Frontiers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and to ſecure the Honour and Liberties of the Republick. They oblige 'em alſo to Swear, to Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the Publick Intereſt, in caſe of a Sedition, or Revolt; To reſtrain the Souldiers from injuring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon; To receive no Money either from the Clergy or Laity, and to hinder the Soldiers from receiving any. After which, they forbid the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Army to March with their Forces into the Heart of the Kingdom, and much leſs near the <hi>Diet,</hi> upon pain of being declared Enemies of the State: And if the Republick ſhould be Attack'd by ſuch Potent Enemies, that the Army ſhou'd not be ſtrong enough to oppoſe them, they declare, That from that Minute they Summon all the Nobility to Meet together without delay at the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63304:79"/>place and time which the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna</hi> and his Council ſhall appoint; That the Review of the Soldiers rais'd in General by the Republick, or in Particular by the <hi>Palatinats,</hi> ſhall be made in the Camp; That each <hi>Palatinat</hi> ſhall take care to pay it's own Troops, and not to Disband any but ſuch as the General <hi>Diet</hi> ſhall think fit to diſmiſs; That the Army ſhall not offer any violence to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or Eſtates of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen or Clergy; and much leſs to the Royal Demeſnes; And that the Officers ſhall be accountable for the Injuries done by their Troops. They forbid the Treaſurers of the Crown, and of the Dutchy to give out any Mony, without the Knowledge and Approbation of the Arch biſhop and his Council, but only for the Payment of the Troops of the Republick; They ordain, that skilful and honeſt perſons ſhall be ſent to viſit the Salt-works, and to regulate the Repa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations that ſhall be found neceſſary; and that the Deputies of certain Cities ſhall not be admitted to the <hi>Diet</hi> till they have prov'd their Right.</p>
               <p>After the Marſhal of the Deputies is Elected, and a Court of Juſtice Eſtabliſhed, for the ſecurity of all that is done during the <hi>Diet,</hi> they begin to treat of the <hi>Exorbitances,</hi> or Irregularities committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Republick in General, or againſt private Perſons. Then they give Audience to the Ainbaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors of all the Princes, who either Aſpire to the Crown, or Recommend ſome of the Pretenders.</p>
               <p>When the Ambaſſadors are to have their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, the Republick ſends for them, beginning with the Pope's Nuncio; then proceeding to the Emperour's Ambaſſador, after him to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſor, and next to that of <hi>Spain:</hi> But, ſince the <hi>Diet</hi> of Election, held at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus,</hi> when the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ambaſſador demanded Audience before the Ambaſſador of <hi>France,</hi> who, notwithſtanding, was
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63304:80"/>preferr'd before him, whereupon he retir'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making his Harangue; there has never been any Ambaſſanor from the Court of <hi>Spain:</hi> For, as for <hi>Don Ronquillos,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miniſter, who was preſent at the <hi>Diet</hi> in 1674. for the Election of the late King <hi>John</hi> III. he never durſt aſſume the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or Quality of Ambaſſador, leaſt he ſhould be oblig'd to give place to the Ambaſſador of <hi>France.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Diet</hi> always ſends ſome of the Senators to the Ambaſſadors. I know not whether there be any Conſtitution that regulates the number of thoſe that are ſent to the Miniſters; but, I remember, the <hi>Diet</hi> in 1674. deputed 2 <hi>Palatins,</hi> and 4 <hi>Caſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lans,</hi> to the Ambaſſador of <hi>France;</hi> and all the Friends of the <hi>French</hi> Faction ſent their Servants and Coaches, ſo that his Train conſiſted of above 100 Coaches, and more than 3000 Men.</p>
               <p>When the Ambaſſadors receive Audience, they make their Harangue in <hi>Latin.</hi> The Arch-biſhop, or Biſhop, who preſides, Anſwers for the Senate, and the Marſhal of the Deputies for the Nobility. The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador, in his return from the Audience, was attended by the ſame Train that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd him thither. And ſince a plentiful En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment is, next to Money, the moſt prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſucceſsful Argument to win the Eſteem and Affection of a <hi>Polander,</hi> it ought to be one of the principal cares of an Ambaſſador, to Treat 'em Liberally, and to allow 'em ſo much, as may not only fill their Stomachs, but intoxicate their Brains.</p>
               <p>Beſides the care that an Ambaſſador ought to take to Manage the Orders of the Senate and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, he ought, in a particular manner, to oblige the <hi>Clergy,</hi> who, by reaſon of their Intereſt and Authority, are moſt capable of rendring his Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiation ſucceſsful. He muſt be always ready to make them conſiderable Preſents, which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive under the notion of Alms; that in their
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63304:80"/>Sermons and private Diſcourſe, they may extol the Liberality and Magnificence of his Maſter: 'Tis plain then that an Ambaſſador ought to be Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to all the various Ranks and Conditions of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that he may gain the Aſſiſtance of ſome, and avoid the Oppoſition of others. Beſides, he ought not to pay 'em all that he promiſes in ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but give them part at firſt, and keep 'em in expectation of the reſt, otherwiſe they do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves oblig'd to keep their Word; and the hopes of receiving more, has a far greater In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon 'em, than the conſideration of what they have receiv'd already.</p>
               <p>I have already obſerv'd, and 'twill not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to repeat it, that an Ambaſſador is oblig'd to Manage all the Senators in General, as 'tis in a particular manner his Intereſt to Manage the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops and Clergy; becauſe they are the Heads and Maſters of Religion, by which the People are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſooneſt gain'd; But, above all, if an Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor deſigns to obtain the Favour of the Senate, be muſt never forget to ſecure the Aſſiſtance of at leaſt one of the moſt Conſiderable Prelates; And 'tis even expedient to Treat the Clergy as well as the Laity. For the Money that is ſpent in Feaſts is ſometimes beſtow'd to better purpoſe, than that which is given away in Preſents, becauſe he that gives Preſents acquires the Jealouſy and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of thoſe whom he neglects; whereas many Perſons at once may be oblig'd by a Well-tim'd En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. Liberality is the moſt neceſſary Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification of an Ambaſſador; for, if he ſhould be Penurious, his Maſter would be accuſed of the ſame fault; and the People, who Judge only by what they ſee, would be apt to believe, that his Parſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was a Mark of the Poverty of the Candidat whom he Repreſents.</p>
               <pb n="142" facs="tcp:63304:81"/>
               <p>'Tis alſo no leſs certain that an Ambaſſador ſhould purſue no other Intereſt than that of his Maſter, that he ſhould ſerve him without any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate deſign, and blindly follow all his Orders and Intentions. 'Tis for this reaſon that the <hi>Popes</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid the <hi>Nuncio's,</hi> whom they ſend to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to the <hi>Diets</hi> of the Election of a King, to make any Intereſt to ſecure the advantage of the Privilege which that Prince has to Nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate one to the Dignity of a Cardinal, that it may appear to all the World, that they are only concern'd for the Publick good of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and that a Miniſter, who is ſent from the Common Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Faithful, comes not thither with a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Partiality; but only with a deſign to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Election of a Prince, who may be able and willing to advance the good of the Church and State. Nevertheleſs, it has been frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that the <hi>Nuncio</hi>'s, contrary to the expreſs Orders of the Soveraign <hi>Pontiff,</hi> have acted zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly for their private Intereſts, and have made great Party's to ſecure the Nomination to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalſhip.</p>
               <p>To return to the <hi>Diet;</hi> after all the Grievances are redreſs'd, and all the Ambaſſadors have had Audience of the Republick, they proceed to the Election of a King; But before they give their Votes, they Implore, upon their knees, the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> by Singing the <hi>Veni Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor;</hi> after which, the Deputies of each <hi>Palatinat</hi> give their Votes, and Communicate 'em to the reſt; and if all the Votes be for one Candidate, the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> or the Biſhop who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in his Pallace, demands thrice, Whether the Grievances be Redreſs'd, and afterwards Proclaims the King Elect, which is alſo done by the Marſhals of the Crown, and of the Dutchy: after which they all Sing the <hi>Te Deum.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:63304:81"/>
               <p>I obſerv'd, that the King Elect, is Proclaim'd by the Arch-biſhop, when all the Votes are for him; For, it may ſometimes happen, that the <hi>Diet</hi> may be divided, in which caſe the ſtrongeſt Party car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries it. Thus in the <hi>Diet</hi> that was held, after the Retreat of <hi>Henry</hi> III. one Party Choſe <hi>Stephen Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tori,</hi> and the other Elected <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Auſtria; Maximilian</hi> deſigning to enter into <hi>Poland</hi> with ſome Troops, was prevented by <hi>Stephen Batori,</hi> who arriv'd before him at <hi>Cracow,</hi> where he was Crown'd the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1576. Thus all the Voices were tranſmitted to King <hi>Stephen,</hi> whom the <hi>Polanders</hi> oblig'd afterwards to Marry the Princeſs <hi>Ann,</hi> whom they had already acknowledg'd for their Queen.</p>
               <p>After the Death of <hi>Stephen Battori,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd a much greater Diviſion in the <hi>Diet;</hi> for there being Two Parties form'd, one of which was ſupported by <hi>Zamoski,</hi> and the other by <hi>Sboroski;</hi> the former Choſe <hi>Signiſmund</hi> III. Son to <hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and <hi>Catherine</hi> Siſter of <hi>Sigiſmund Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus,</hi> the laſt of the Race of <hi>Jagellon,</hi> and Nephew to Queen <hi>Ann</hi> the Relict of King <hi>Stephen;</hi> and this Party was ſo ſtrong, that they Crown'd <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> at <hi>Cracow</hi> the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>December,</hi> 1587. tho' <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> who was Elected by <hi>Sborosky</hi>'s Party, had been Proclaim'd King in the Church of the <hi>Bernardins</hi> at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> by Cardinal <hi>Radziwill,</hi> who was of his Faction. In the mean time <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milian</hi> entering into <hi>Poland</hi> with ſome Troops, <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moski</hi> purſu'd him to <hi>Byczin</hi> in <hi>Sileſia,</hi> where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and took him Priſoner, <hi>Jan.</hi> 25. 1587. and oblig'd him to renounce his Title to the Crown. So that <hi>Maximilian</hi> was a Second time excluded from the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the Princes of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria</hi> a Third time; <hi>Firſt,</hi> In the Perſon of <hi>Erneſt,</hi> by the Election of <hi>Henry de Valois; Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> In <hi>Maximilian,</hi> by that of <hi>Steven Battori;</hi> And

               <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of the</hi> Election <hi>of a</hi> Succeſſor.</head>
               <p>THo' the Election of a Succeſſor is contrary to the Laws and Conſtitutions of <hi>Poland,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Privileges of an Elective King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; it may ſometimes happen, that the natural affection, which moſt perſons have for their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or Relations, may induce them to make Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's in the Republick, to get them Choſen during their Life: Thus in the Reign of <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> I. his Son <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus,</hi> tho' but Ten years old, was nam'd King during his Father's Life, upon theſe Conditions; That he ſhould not, in the leaſt, med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Affairs of <hi>Poland</hi> till after his Father's death; That when he came to be Fifteen years old, he ſhould Swear to maintain all the Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Republick; And, that this Example ſhould not prejudice a Free Election for the future; which his Father Confirm'd by Letters Patents gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at <hi>Cracow,</hi> 1530. And afterwards by other Letters dated at <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>otrkow,</hi> 1538. for that Prince lived 82 years. But <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus</hi> being dead, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick being Aſſembl'd in a <hi>Diet</hi> held at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> after they had carefully examin'd the Ancient Laws of the Kingdom, made a Conſtitution, by which they expreſly Prohibited the Nomination of any Succeſſor for the future, during the Life of the Reigning Prince, that they might Inviolably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Right and Liberty of Chooſing any So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign they pleas'd.</p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:63304:82"/>
               <p>Nevertheleſs <hi>Stephen Battori</hi> ſeeing he had no Children, and conſidering the danger to which the Republick was expos'd during the Two laſt <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnums,</hi> propos'd the Election of a Succeſſor in a <hi>Diet</hi> held at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> contrary to the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Conſtitution; But the whole Order of the Nobility oppos'd the Deſign of that Great King, who died ſoon after at <hi>Grodno</hi> in <hi>Lithuania, Decem.</hi> 12. 1586.</p>
               <p>Since any Chriſtian Prince may aſpire to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> 'tis evidently the Intereſt of 'em all to oppoſe the Election of a Succeſſor, which might render the Kingdom Hereditary, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ruin their Pretenſions.</p>
               <p>'Twas this Conſideration that oblig'd the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Emperor to ſend <hi>Francis de Liſola</hi> to the <hi>Diet</hi> held at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> in the Year 1661. to oppoſe the Deſign of King <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> who wou'd have had a Prince Choſen to Succeed him after his death: And this Envoy, with the Aſſiſtance of <hi>John Ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erbeck,</hi> Envoy of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who was alſo apprehenſive of the ſame deſign, form'd a ſtrong Party, and was ſo effectually ſeconded by Marſhal <hi>Lubomirski,</hi> that they broke <hi>Caſimir</hi>'s deſign, and prevail'd with the <hi>Diet</hi> to make a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, forbidding any perſon, for the future, to make mention of the Election of a Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.</p>
               <p>The reaſon why King <hi>John Caſimir</hi> Summon'd a <hi>Diet</hi> at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> to deliberate about the Election of a Succeſſor, was, becauſe that Prince conſider'd the danger to which the Republick had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd for above Twelve years, during which they had Maintain'd a War againſt the <hi>Coſſacks, Tartars, Muſcovites, Swedes, Tranſilvanians,</hi> and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> and that none of all thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies would have Invaded <hi>Poland,</hi> if they had not been incourag'd by his want of Iſſue. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63304:83"/>he look'd upon the Election of a Succeſſor, as the moſt effectual way to prevent the diſorders that might be occaſion'd during an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> by the Jealouſie and Ambition of the Neighbouring PrInces, and eſpecially of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to make themſelves Maſters of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and to make all the Inhabitants Slaves.</p>
               <p>There were alſo many <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Gentlemen who were engag'd in the ſame deſign with King <hi>Caſimire,</hi> and had earneſtly deſir'd that Prince, and the Nobility of <hi>Poland,</hi> to Conſent to the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Succeſſor, who might be able, after the King's death, to oppoſe the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> who only waited for that opportunity to enter into <hi>Lithuania</hi> with a great Army, and to poſſeſs themſelves of that Dutchy.</p>
               <p>A conſiderable Number of the Nobility were prevail'd with to comply with the intended Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Succeſſor upon theſe Conditions; That he ſhould be Choſen again after the death of the King; That he ſhould be a <hi>Roman Catholick;</hi> That he ſhould not be a <hi>Piaſte,</hi> that is, a Native <hi>Polander;</hi> That he ſhould not be a King, or Soveraign Prince of any other Country; That he ſhould not be a Neighbour of <hi>Poland;</hi> That he ſhou'd be an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marry'd Perſon, and one that was neither too young, nor too old.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd that the deſign was good: for the King, and thoſe who ſeconded his deſire, look'd upon this as the beſt (if not the only) Expedient, to ſecure the Republick from the otherwiſe unavoidable dangers, to which it wou'd be expos'd during an <hi>Interregnum,</hi> by the Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it's Neighbours, and the Jealouſy and Factions of thoſe who ſhou'd aſpire to the Crown. But thoſe who oppos'd the Election of a Succeſſor, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd on the other hand, That no Prudent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wou'd venture upon a preſent danger, to
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63304:83"/>avoid a future inconveniency; That ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation wou'd introduce a Hereditary Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and entirely deſtroy the Liberty of Elections, notwithſtanding all the meaſures that cou'd be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to ſecure it; That 'twas contrary to the Laws of the Kingdom to Chuſe a Prince during the Life of the King; That the Republick cou'd not conſent to ſuch an Election without diveſting it ſelf of its Liberty; That the Choice cou'd not be determin'd without offending ſeveral Princes, and involving the Nation in new Troubles, at a time when 'twas their Intereſt to maintain an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted Peace with all their Neighbours.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the moſt Material Arguments that were urg'd on both ſides: I leave it to the Reader to Judge, which of 'em were moſt agreeable to Reaſon, that I may proceed to acquaint him with the nature of the <hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> which the King Elect Swears to obſerve, in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church at <hi>Warſaw.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XVIII. <hi>Of the</hi> Pacta Conventa, <hi>or the Contract betwixt the</hi> King <hi>and the</hi> People.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Polanders</hi> are ſo fond of their Liberty and ſo afraid of loſing it, that as ſoon as the King is Elected, they make Him Swear upon the Altars to maintain all their Privileges during His Reign. This is uſually call'd the <hi>Pacta Conventa.</hi> which is properly a Contract betwixt the King and the People, by which the former is oblig'd to preſerve all the Rights and Immunities of the latter.</p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:63304:84"/>
               <p>According to the Laws of <hi>Poland,</hi> this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Ceremony ought to be perform'd before the King be Proclaim'd. Thus at the Election of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Valois,</hi> after they had rejected <hi>Erneſt</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> the Emperor's Son, and Confirm'd the Election of King <hi>Henry, John de Monluc</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Valence,</hi> that Prince's Ambaſſador, was oblig'd by the Senate to come to the <hi>Diet,</hi> where the Conditions that were to be obſerv'd by the New King, his Maſter, were Read in his Preſence: After which he took an Oath to Obſerve 'em in the Name of <hi>Henry de Valois,</hi> and his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> IX. Then he was conducted to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church, where, after the Celebration of the Maſs, <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was Proclaim'd King of <hi>Poland</hi> by the Great Marſhal of the Crown, <hi>May</hi> 18. 1573. Afterwards the Ambaſſadors that were ſent by the Republick, to offer the Crown to King <hi>Henry,</hi> oblig'd both him and his Brother to take the ſame Oath at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> in the Great Hall of the Palace, on the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> following. This is the Method pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd by the Laws for Swearing to keep the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta Conventa;</hi> But this Regulation is not always punctually obſerv'd; For both King <hi>Michael Vicz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowieski,</hi> and <hi>John Sohieski,</hi> took the Oath ſeveral days after their Election at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> upon the great Altar of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> or Contract, is drawn up and Methodiz'd by the Order of the <hi>Senate</hi> and Nobility; after which the Three Orders go to Church, where the Great Marſhal Reads the whole Contract aloud, of which theſe are the principal Articles.</p>
               <p>That the King ſhall not aſſume the Quality, or Title of Heir of <hi>Poland,</hi> nor appoint any Perſon to Succeed him: but that on the contrary, he ſhall Inviolably preſerve and maintain the Laws and Conſtitutions relating to the Free Election of a King.</p>
               <pb n="149" facs="tcp:63304:84"/>
               <p>That he ſhall Ratify all the Treaties of Peace made with Foreign Princes.</p>
               <p>That he ſhall make it his principal care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Publick Quiet and Tranquility.</p>
               <p>That he ſhall not pretend to the Right of Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Money, or deprive the Republick of the profits of the Coinage.</p>
               <p>That, without the Conſent of the Republick, he ſhall neither declare War againſt any Prince, nor give Orders for the levying of Forces. And that, without the ſame conſent, he ſhall neither bring any Soldiers into the Kingdom, nor ſuffer any to go out of it.</p>
               <p>That he ſhall not introduce any Strangers, of what Rank or Quality ſoever into his Council; and that he ſhall not beſtow any Offices, Dignities or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments upon 'em.</p>
               <p>That all the Officers ſhall be <hi>Polanders,</hi> or <hi>Lithua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> or at leaſt Natives of ſuch Provinces as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Crown of <hi>Poland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the Officers of the Regiment of Guards ſhall be Natives of <hi>Poland,</hi> or <hi>Lithuania;</hi> that the Colonel ſhall be a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentleman, that he ſhall take an Oath of Fidelity to the Republick; and that all the Officers ſhall be under the Juriſdiction of the Marſhals.</p>
               <p>That the King ſhall not Marry without the conſent of the <hi>Senate,</hi> according to the Ancient Laws of the Kingdom; and that the Train and Attendants of the Princeſs, whom he ſhall Marry, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by the <hi>Senate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That he ſhall never make uſe of his private Signet, in Affairs that concern the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</p>
               <p>That for the preſervation of his Power and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he ſhall diſpoſe of the Offices both of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick and Court; leaſt they ſhou'd be either
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:63304:85"/>uſurp'd, or remain vacant; and that the number of 'em ſhall not be diminiſh'd.</p>
               <p>That he ſhall Adminiſter Juſtice, according to the Advice of the Senators and Counſellors that attend upon him.</p>
               <p>That, for the Expences of his Table, he ſhall only poſſeſs thoſe Revenues that were granted by the Republick to the Kings his Predeceſſors; and that he ſhall enjoy 'em only for his Life.</p>
               <p>That he ſhall not confer upon any one Perſon the Offices or Dignities, which, according to the Ancient Laws, ought not to be poſſeſs'd by one Man.</p>
               <p>That he ſhall take care, in the ſpace of ſix weeks, to fill up all the vacant Offices.</p>
               <p>That the firſt thing he ſhall do in the <hi>Diet,</hi> ſhall be to diſpoſe of the Vacancy's, and to cauſe the Chancellor to publiſh them; and that in purſuance of the Laws he ſhall only beſtow them on <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen, who are Perſons of Merit, of the Age requir'd by Law, and of a ſtaid and ſolid Judgment.</p>
               <p>That he and his Council ſhall ſo regulate the Troops, as well Horſe as Foot, that the Republick may not ſtand in need of any Foreign Troops, nor be put to an unuſual Expence, and that the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers ſhall be ſatisfy'd with their pay, and do no injury to the Peaſants.</p>
               <p>That heſh all in no wiſe diminiſh the Treaſure at <hi>Cracow,</hi> but on the contrary ſhall endeavour to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it.</p>
               <p>That he ſhall borrow no Money, but with the Conſent of the Republick.</p>
               <p>That if the Exigences of the State require Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val forces, he ſhall not pretend to Levy 'em with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the approbation of the Nobility, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Senate.</p>
               <p>And finally, That all the Rights, Liberties, and Privileges, that have been juſtly and lawfully grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:63304:85"/>to the <hi>Polanders, Lithuanians,</hi> and to all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Provinces depending on them, and to all the Cities, according to what has been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd in the preceding <hi>Diets,</hi> and to what ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards be ordained in the following <hi>Diets,</hi> ſhall be inviolably kept and preſerv'd; and that he ſhall iſſue out his Letters Pattents to Confirm them in all their Clauſes and Conditions.</p>
               <p>They alſo frequently add ſeveral other Articles according to the exigency of the preſent Juncture, and the Quality and Circumſtances of the Elected Prince.</p>
               <p>As for the Ceremonies that are uſed when they make the King Swear the Capitulation, The Arch-biſhop, and the Marſhal of the Deputies car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it before him, after the Maſs is ſaid, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him to take an Oath to obſerve it, according to his promiſe. Then the King being upon his Knees before the Great Altar, ſays, after the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We N. Choſen King of</hi> Poland, <hi>and Great Duke of</hi> Lithuania, Ruſſia, Pruſſia, Maſſovia, Samogitia, Kio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, Volhinia, Podolia, Podlaſſia, Livonia, Smolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sko, Siberia <hi>and</hi> Czernichovia, <hi>Promiſe to Almighty God, and Swear upon the Holy Evangeliſts of Jeſus Chriſt, to obſerve, maintain, and accompliſh all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions agreed upon at our Election, by our Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, with the Senators and Deputies of</hi> Poland, <hi>and of the Great Dutchy of</hi> Lithuania, <hi>and Confirmed by the Oath of our Ambaſſadors; and to perform the ſame accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to all the Clauſes, Points, Articles and Conditions mention'd therein, and in ſuch ſort that the ſpeciality can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not derogate from the generality, nor the generality from the ſpeciality. All which we promiſe to Ratifie by our Oath on the Day of Our Coronation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the King has Sworn to keep the <hi>Pacta Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venta,</hi> the Chancellor gives him the Decree of his Election Written in Parchment, and Signed by the Senators and Deputies.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:63304:86"/>
               <p>The Republick of <hi>Poland</hi> uſes theſe Precautions at the Election of their King, that if afterwards he ſhould act contrary to what he promiſes to obſorve, the Senators may have a right to put him in mind of his duty. It was the breach of one of thoſe Articles, which gave the <hi>Polanders</hi> occaſion to complain of King <hi>Michael;</hi> for, in the <hi>Pacta Conventa</hi> which he Swore to obſerve, they had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted this Article; That he ſhould not Marry any Princeſs without the Conſent of the Republick: Nevertheleſs, without asking their Conſent, he Marry'd the Emperor's Siſter; and the Party that was form'd againſt him look'd upon this as a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to compel him to Abdicate.</p>
               <p>If the Prince who is Elected be not preſent at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> he takes the Oath in the preſence of the Deputies, whom the Republick ſends for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and obliges himſelf before them, to obſerve all the Articles of the Capitulation. 'Twas thus that <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> the Third Swore to keep the <hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> in the Abby of <hi>Oliva,</hi> near <hi>Dantzick, Anno</hi> 1587. as they were drawn up by the Senate and the Nobility.</p>
               <p>'Tis the Cuſtom in <hi>Poland,</hi> that the Great Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, or in his abſence the Petty Marſhal, carries the Staff erect before the King when he goes to any Ceremony. But 'tis obſervable, that from the time of his Election to his Coronation, they carry the Staff bow'd down, that when the King Iſſues out any Letters, Orders or Conſtitutions, he only aſſumes the Quality of King Elect; and that no Diſpatches can be Sealed but with the little Seal of the Cloſet, which is a ſign that the Election is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by the Coronation, which is, as it were, the Seal of it.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIX. <hi>Of the King's</hi> Coronation.</head>
               <p>A KING of <hi>Poland</hi> cannot exerciſe the Royal Authority before his Coronation: for he can neither diſpoſe of any Office nor Beneſice, nor ſo much as grant any Favour, nor uſe the Great Seal of the Chancery: and the Courts of Juſtice which ought to be kept in his Name, and are ſhut up at the beginning of the <hi>Interregnum,</hi> cannot make a Decree till after his Coronation.</p>
               <p>Tis the New King who appoints the Day for this Ceremony, which muſt be perform'd at <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi> in the Cathedral Church, in the Caſtle. This City takes its Name from King <hi>Cracus,</hi> who built it in the Year 700, after he had left <hi>Gneſna,</hi> which was formerly the Capital City of the Kingdom. It is ſcituated on the <hi>Viſtula,</hi> in Upper <hi>Poland.</hi> 'Tis the Seat of a Biſhop, who is a Suffragan of the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Gneſna:</hi> The City is very large, fine, and well-built, but the Streets are ill Paved, as in moſt other Cities of that Country: Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Streets are very broad, and ſtraight, with a great Square in the middle, where the Town-houſe is built. The Caſtle, or the King's Palace, is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a little Eminence, or Rock, the Foot of which is waſhed by the <hi>Viſlula.</hi> The Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of this Eminence is very ſmall, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Palace is of no very great Extent; and as for the Church, tho it be the Cathedral of a great Dioceſs, and the Burying-place of the Kings of <hi>Poland;</hi> 'tis one of the ſmalleſt and leaſt Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Structures of that kind that I have had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſee in that Country.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:63304:87"/>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledg'd, that the King's Houſe is really well built; but beſides the extraordinary ſmallneſs and obſcurity of the Court, it has neither Garden, Wood, nor Water; nor is it adorn'd with any Walls, or Avenues; It was formerly a ſtrong place, when the ſtrength of places conſiſted in the height of their Scituation, but 'tis now on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fit to refiſt ſome flying Parties of Horſe: 'tis here where the Jewels of the Crown are kept with the Royal Ornaments, that are uſed at the King's Coronation. There is alſo to be ſeen in the Little Hill, or Riſing Ground, on which it ſtands, the Cave or Den of that Furious Dragon, which made ſuch a terrible havock in all the Neighbouring places, and which, 'tis ſaid, <hi>Cracus</hi> killed, by laying ſome Meat for him, mixt with Pitch and Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone.</p>
               <p>When the Coronation-Day draws near, the King makes his Entry into <hi>Cracow</hi> on Horſeback, the Sheriffs of the City carrying a Canopy of State before him. The Troops, both Horſe and Foot March before, with their Officers; and are follow'd by the <hi>Palatines, Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. The Ceremony is doubtleſs very Splendid, and I know not where a Traveller can have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſee a more Magnificent Cavalcade. A Man who rides on Horſeback before the King, ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſome ſmall pieces of Silver, ſtampt with the Effigies of the New King, among the People in the Streets; but this Liberality coſts him ſo little, that I do not believe there are a hundred Crowns di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed. Thus the King is conducted from the City Gate to the Caſtle, paſſing thro the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick place, where there are ſeveral Triumphal Arches adorn'd with Statues, Devices, and various Inſcriptions.</p>
               <p>On the day that precedes the Coronation, which is called the day of Expiation, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63304:87"/>the Funeral of the Deceaſed King, whoſe Body is carry'd to the Church of St. <hi>Staniſlaus</hi> at <hi>Schalka,</hi> where the Marſhalls break their Staves, and the Chancellors their Seals againſt the King's Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin. The New King goes alſo thither with all the Officers of the Crown and Dutchy, and all that are preſent at Court. The Company's of Tradeſmen walk thither bare-foot in Proceſſion, each of them accompany'd with the repreſentation of a Coffin cover'd with a Pall, ſupported by two Men. Thus the whole Multitude goes to viſit the Relicks of St. <hi>Stanislaus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cracow,</hi> who was kill'd in the Year 1079 by King <hi>Boleslaus,</hi> as he was ſaying Maſs. After which they bring back the Body of the Deceaſed King to the Chapel of the Cathedral Church, which is the Burying-place of His Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors.</p>
               <p>The day after the Funeral is the Coronation-Day; The Ceremony ought to be perform'd by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> as Primate of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; yet there are ſome Examples to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. For <hi>Stephen Battori</hi> was Crowned by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Cracow,</hi> becauſe the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna</hi> was of the Faction of <hi>Maximilian</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> whom a Party of <hi>Polanders</hi> had Choſen; and the late King <hi>John Sobieski</hi> was Crowned by the Biſhop of <hi>Cracow,</hi> becauſe the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>a</hi> died during the <hi>Diet</hi> of Election.</p>
               <p>This day the King being Richly Cloathed, is conducted in Solemn Proceſſion to the Cathedral Church, by the Senate and the Nobility. Before he enters into the Church, the Great Maſter of the Horſe of the Kingdom brings the Crown, Scepter, Globe of Gold, and the Naked Sword to the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop, who lays 'em upon the Altar; after which the Biſhop of <hi>Cracow</hi> and <hi>Cujavia,</hi> having receiv'd the King, and bolding Him between them, preſent Him to the Archbiſhop, to whom he makes a bow.</p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:63304:88"/>
               <p>The King being in this condition, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, and the Two Biſhops put him in mind of his Duty, and Obligation to the Republick; after which he kiſſes the Archbiſhops hand, and laying his own upon the Goſpel, he Swears to obſerve Inviolably all the Articles which he had before Sworn to keep in the Cathedral Church of St. <hi>John</hi> at <hi>VVarſaw.</hi> The Oath runs thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>VVe</hi> N. <hi>Choſen King of</hi> Poland, <hi>and Great Duke of</hi> Lithuania, Ruſſia, Maſſovia, Pruſſia, Samogitia, Livonia, Smolensko, Volhinia, Kiovia, Siberia, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolia, Podlaſſia, and Czernikowia, <hi>by all the Orders of both Eſtates of</hi> Poland, <hi>and</hi> Lithuania, <hi>and of all the Provinces which depend upon them, and are Incorporated with them, having been Elected freely, and with the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>

               <p>
                  <hi>Moreover, we promiſe to maintain whatſever was Fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ed or Agreed upon in the Diet of our Election, or ſhall be Enacted or Agreed upon in that of our Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to execute the ſame, and to cauſe to be reſtored to the Kingdom, and to the Great</hi> Dutchy <hi>of</hi> Lithuania, <hi>and united to their Lands and Revenues whatſoever has been in any in owner alinated, or diſmembred therefront
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63304:88"/>by what way ſoever; Not to contract the limits of the Kingdom, and Great</hi> Dutchy <hi>of</hi> Lithuania, <hi>but to defend and enlarge them; to eſtabliſh Courts of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in all places, for all the Inhabitants of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the</hi> Dutchy <hi>of</hi> Lithuania, <hi>and to render Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice to every one without delay, or reſpect to perſons. And if it ſhould happen (which God forbid) that we ſhould violate Our Oath in any one point, we conſent that all the Inhabitants of the Kingdom, and of all our Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, ſhall be diſcharg'd and exempted from the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Fidelity they owe us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the King has taken this Oath, He kneels upon a Cuſhion of Red Taffeta, while the <hi>Litany</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> is Read; at the end of which they take off his Clothes, and the Archbiſhop Anoints his Right hand and Arm up to the Elbow with Conſecrated Oil, and afterwards his Shoulders and Forehead; and then they put on his Clothes again. After this Ceremony, the two Biſhops Conduct him to the Chapel, where they Cloath him with another Habit, ſomewhat reſembling that of a Biſhop; then the Marſhals of the Crown and Dutchy, with the Officers that are Senators, place him upon a Throne erected in the Middle of the Church, where He hears Maſs, and is afterwards brought back to the Altar, where the Archbiſhop puts a Naked Sword into his Right-hand, ſaying, <q>
                     <hi>Receive this Sword, with which you are powerfully to Protect and Defend the Holy Church and the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</hi>
                  </q> After which the Great Standard-bearer of the Kingdom Girds it to his ſide: The King ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sword by His ſide, draws it out of the Scabbard, and beats the Air four times, in form of a Croſs, towards the Four Parts of the World; and having wip'd it upon his Left Arm, he puts it up again into the Seabbard. Then he kneels, and the Archbiſhop puts the Crown upon His Head, the Scepter into His Right hand, and the Globe of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63304:89"/>Gold into His Left. After which the King riſes, and His Sword is drawn and given to the Sword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer of the Kingdom, to be carry'd before Him; and then Marching between the Archbiſhop and the Two Biſhops, He is brought back to the ſame Throne.</p>
               <p>All theſe Ceremonies being ended, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop returns to the Altar; and after <hi>Te Deum</hi> is Sung, and that Prelate Seated, the King comes to make His Confeſſion to him; after which he gives the Sacrament to His Majeſty, and then the Benediction to the People. This done, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal of the Court Cries, <hi>Vivat Rex;</hi> and is Anſwer'd by all the People, who Repeat the ſame words. In the mean time the Treaſurer of the Kingdom ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Money among the People who are in the Church. 'Twou'd be needleſs to deſcribe the Feaſt that uſually follows this Ceremony, ſince I intend in a peculiar Chapter to give a particular Account of the Feaſts and Entertainments of the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> Only it may be reaſonably ſuppos'd, that a Feaſt which a King makes, after His Coronation, is very Splendid and Magnificent.</p>
               <p>The Day after the Coronation, the King goes in Great Pomp, being Cloathed in His Royal Robes, to the Town-houſe, where, upon a Throne Erected before the Houſe, the Magiſtrates come to Aſſure him of their Fidelity, and preſent him with the Keys of all the Gates in a Silver Diſh: the Chancellor, or Vice-Chancellor, aſſures them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally of the Affection and Clemency of the King, and Reads, with an Audible Voice, the Oath of Fidelity, which they take kneeling, and holding up their hands. Then they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent His Majeſty with a Purſe full of Ducats; after which he reſtores the Keys, and makes ſome of the Burgeſſes of the City, or of ſome other place, Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Knights, by ſtriking them ſoftly with his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63304:89"/>Sword upon the Shoulders. This done, the Treaſurer of the Crown ſcatters ſome Pieces of Silver among the People: at the ſame time the King goes to a Houſe that looks into the Square, and afterwards returns to the Caſtle with the ſame Train that Accompany'd him to the Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</p>
               <p>I have already obſerv'd, that 'tis the Intereſt of the King of <hi>Poland</hi> to get himſelf Crown'd as ſoon as 'tis poſſible, and I ſhall take this occaſion to ſhew what advantage he receives by it. 'Tis certain, that aſſoon as the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Noblemen have Choſen their King, they begin to look upon him as an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurper of their Liberties; and, on the other hand, the King looks upon the Nobility as a Formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Body, that oppoſes all his Deſigns. Now he cannot either weaken them, or ſtrengthen him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more effectually, than by making 'em pay dear for the Favors he beſtows upon 'em. For, 'tis in his power to diſpoſe of all the Offices, Beneſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and Royal Gifts, which amonnt to a third part of all the Revenues of the Kingdom; which he cannot do till after his Coronation.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, the late King was ſo far from ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving this Maxim, that tho' he might have been Crown'd immediately after the Day of his Election, which was <hi>May</hi> 19. 1674. he did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the Day for his Coronation till <hi>Feb.</hi> 2. 1676. during which time he made Two Campagnes, one in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> and the other in <hi>Podolia.</hi> As for that in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> he ſet out from <hi>Warſaw, Auguſt</hi> 22. 1674. and advanc'd towards <hi>Leopold,</hi> where his Army was to Rendezvous. There he was inform'd, that the Queen his Wife lay ſick at <hi>Caſimirs</hi> upon the <hi>Viſtula;</hi> Whereupon he left the Camp at <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold,</hi> and arriv'd at <hi>Caſimirs</hi> on the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>October.</hi> Not long after he return'd to the Army, becauſe the Nights began to grow ſo cold, that the <hi>Turks</hi>
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:63304:90"/>who are not accuſtom'd to ſuch a Cold Climate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think of retiring.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Turks</hi> had withdrawn their Forces, the King led the Army of the Crown, and that of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> which both together amounted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 30000 Men, into <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> where he kept them ſo long, that the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Troops, under the Command of the Great General <hi>Patz,</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd him, to avoid the Miſerable Fate of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, which was ſo haraſs'd with Hunger and Cold, that it was reduc'd to leſs than 3000 Men; for the King ſtaid in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania</hi> till <hi>April,</hi> and arriv'd on the <hi>25th</hi> of that Month at <hi>Sloczow,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Queen was come to receive him.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> underſtanding that the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army was ruin'd in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> that the King was gone back with the Miſerable Remnants of his Forces, and that thoſe of <hi>Lithuania</hi> had left him againſt his will, they return'd with a Great Army in the beginning of <hi>July,</hi> 1675, when the King was at <hi>Jawarow,</hi> thinking of nothing but to refreſh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf after the Fatigues of the Preceding Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. But upon the firſt Advice of the March of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Army, which conſiſted of 30000 <hi>Turks,</hi> and 80000 <hi>Tartars;</hi> he ſet out from <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warow</hi> the <hi>10th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and Marched in haſt to <hi>Leopold,</hi> which the <hi>Turks</hi> threatned to Beſiege. He Encamp'd near the City with about 3000 Men, whom he had drawn together; and the <hi>Turks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inform'd of his weakneſs, ſent a Body of 14000 <hi>Tartars</hi> to force his Camp, but they durſt not Attack him. 'Twas given out, that a great number of <hi>Tartars</hi> were killed on the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> 1675, in the Attack of the Camp at <hi>Leopold,</hi> tho' 'tis certain that there was only one Horſe wounded with an Arrow. For the <hi>Tartars</hi> retir'd without loſing one of their Men, or wounding one of their Enemies.</p>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:63304:90"/>
               <p>The <hi>Turks,</hi> as I intimated before, are not able to bear the extream coldneſs of the Winter in <hi>Poland;</hi> for, having once enter'd <hi>Ruſſia</hi> with a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable Army, and not returning ſoon enough, they were ſurpriz'd with ſo violent a Cold, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove 40000 of 'em were Frozen to death, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were found dead in their Horſes Bellies, into which they had crept to ſecure themſelves from the Cold.

               <head>CHAP. XX. <hi>Of the</hi> Queens <hi>of</hi> Poland.</head>
               <p>HAVING Diſcours'd at length of the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> and of their Election and Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it will not be improper to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Queens: 'Tis certainly of great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to the Republick, that a King, when he Marries, ſhould chooſe a Princeſs, whoſe Alliance may be advantageous to the State. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Article is inſerted in the <hi>Paeta Conventa,</hi> which the New King Swears to obſerve, that he ſhall not Marry without the Conſent of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. For they are as much concern'd as the King himſelf, in the Choice of a Queen, tho' the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility are not oblig'd to Chooſe any of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Succeed him. So that a King of <hi>Poland</hi> cannot Marry without the Conſent of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, unleſs he reſolve to violate his Oath, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to the Jealouſy and Hatred of His peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are not eaſily pacify'd on ſuch occaſions. Thus when <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III. Marry'd <hi>Ann</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> without the Conſent of the Republick, and cauſed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63304:91"/>her to be Crown'd at <hi>Cracow</hi> in the Year 1592, he met with ſo much oppoſition in the <hi>Diet,</hi> that was afterwards held at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> that he was forc'd to acknowledge his Fault.</p>
               <p>As a King of <hi>Poland</hi> cannot Marry without the Conſent of the Republick, ſo he cannot Divorce his Wife without the ſame Approbation. For when <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus,</hi> the laſt of the Race of the <hi>Jagellons,</hi> ſeparated from <hi>Elizabeth</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> becauſe of a Crime with which ſhe was falſly charg'd, and after her Death Marry'd one <hi>Radzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will,</hi> a Widow of a <hi>Palatin</hi> of <hi>Troki;</hi> The Senators were ſo exaſperated, that they had almoſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to declare the Throne Vacant, becauſe he ſlighted his Fair and Chaſt Queen and Wife, and Marry'd the Widow of a ſimple <hi>Palatin,</hi> without the Conſent of the Republick.</p>
               <p>But <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> the IV. purſu'd wiſer Maxims: He was ſenſible of the danger of Irritating a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and ſeditious People, and had a more tender regard to the Articles he had Sworn to obſerve. For when the King of <hi>England</hi> offer'd him his Niece, the Elector <hi>Palatine</hi>'s Daughter in Marriage, he declin'd the Match, and declar'd, that he neither cou'd nor wou'd Marry without the Conſent of the Republick; which, in that caſe, he could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to obtain, becauſe the Princeſs was a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
               <p>When a King of <hi>Poland</hi> Marries after his Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the Queen cannot be Crown'd without the Conſent of the Republick. But if he be Marry'd before, he may cauſe her alſo to be Crown'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking their Conſent. So that the Report which was ſpread abroad, after the Election of the late King <hi>John</hi> III, was falſe and groundleſs: for 'twas given out, That the Queen his Wife would not be Crown'd, and that the <hi>auſtrian</hi> Faction op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd it, both becauſe ſhe was a <hi>French-woman</hi> born,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63304:91"/>and becauſe ſhe was but a private Gentlewoman; But the event ſhow'd the contrary; for ſhe was Crown'd at <hi>Cracow</hi> with her Husband, without the leaſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. But if a Queen of <hi>Poland</hi> be not a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick, ſhe cannot be Crown'd, as it happen'd to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Alexander</hi> I. and Daughter to the Duke of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> who being of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, and refuſing to imbrace the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Faith, the Republick would never conſent that She ſhould be Crown'd.</p>
               <p>Tho' according to the Conſtitutions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, and the Ancient Laws of the Kingdom, both the Kings and Queens of <hi>Poland</hi> ought to be Crown'd at <hi>Cracow;</hi> we find that this Ceremony has been ſometimes perform'd in other places. For Queen <hi>Cecilia,</hi> the Wife of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> IV. was Crown'd at <hi>Warſaw</hi> in the Year 1637. And tho' there was a Law made the next Year, that the Queens ſhould always be Crown'd at <hi>Warſaw, Anno</hi> 1670. 'Tis true, this was done with the conſent of all the Orders of the Republick.</p>
               <p>When the Queen is Crown'd, the King muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it of the Republick; he muſt be preſent at the Ceremony himſelf; Conduct her to the Church, and preſent her to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> or to the Biſhop who is to perform the Ceremony. The Archbiſhop Anoints Her with the Conſecrated Oil, and puts the Crown upon Her head, the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into Her right hand, and the Globe of Gold into Her left.</p>
               <p>The Queens of <hi>Poland</hi> have no Officers, but a Marſhal and a Chancellor; neither of whom are Senators, but only Judges of the Differences that happen among her Domeſticks. They Anſwer the Harangues that are made to the Queen, when an Ambaſſador makes her a Compliment in His Maſter's Name, or when a Preſent is made to her at the Marriage of a Maid of Honour.</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:63304:92"/>
               <p>The King furniſhes the Queen with Money, to defray the Charge of her Houſhold. But after the King's death ſhe muſt maintain her ſelf, and all her Retinue, with the Revenue which the King beſtows upon her, with the Conſent of the Republick, both for her Dowry, and for her Marriage-Preſent. Theſe Revenues are call'd the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of the Reverſion of a certain number of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſties,</hi> which ſhe cannot enjoy till they become vacant by the Death of the preſent Poſſeſſors. So that a Queen of <hi>Poland</hi> is frequently kept from her Eſtate till ſhe be juſt ready to leave it. For ſometimes thoſe who poſſeſs the <hi>Staroſties</hi> that are in her <hi>Reformation,</hi> out-live her. But if the King die before the Queen's <hi>Reformation</hi> be ſettled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, the Republick allows her a Yearly Penſion out of the Crown-Lands, as they did to Queen <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leanor</hi> in the Year 1674, after the Election of King <hi>John;</hi> for they were ſo king to that Princeſs, as to give her a Yearly Penſion of 120000 <hi>Livres,</hi> by an expreſs Article which was afterwards inſerted in the <hi>Pacta Conventa;</hi> but ſhe choſe rather to quit both that and the Kingdom, than to ſee a <hi>French</hi> Gentlewoman ſucceed a Princeſs of the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXI. <hi>Of the</hi> Poliſh Army.</head>
               <p>THERE is ſo little Order or Diſcipline ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, that the Country is frequently harraſs'd by thoſe who are paid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, and the Republick is oblig'd to Raiſe New Troops every Year.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:63304:92"/>
               <p>At the firſt there were few Cities in <hi>Poland;</hi> But when the Inhabitants grew more Induſtrious in Cultivating the Ground, they were perpetually moleſted by their Neighbours, who, by frequent Inrodes, endeavour'd to deprive 'em of the fruit of their Labours. In order to oppoſe theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſions, the Kings cauſed Caſtles and Fortreſſes to be built in the Cities, which always ſubſiſted ſo long as they were Protected by the Royal Authority, and defended by good Officers, and Diſciplin'd Soldiers: But ſince thoſe Forts were neglected, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lords have endeavour'd to uſurp the Poſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of 'em, that they might extend their Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the Cities, and oppreſs the Burghers as they do the Peaſants in the Villages. Thoſe whom the Kings entruſted with the Government of thoſe Places, did not employ the Revenues that were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex'd to 'em, in Repairing the Walls and Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catious; whence it comes that all their Cities are open; and that the Soldiers, who are put there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Winter Quarters, may go out when they pleaſe and Ravage the Country. For when a Regiment is to be ſent from one end of the Kingdom to the other, the Commander is only Order'd to ſet out, and to go to the place appointed, without menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning either the time, or the places through which he is to March, or the Cities where he is to Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that he may run through the Whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſo ſometimes ſpend a Moneth or ſix Weeks in Marching to a place, which he might have reach'd in Eight days. 'Tis plain, that theſe diſorderly Marches muſt of neceſſity waſte and deſtroy the Cities and Villages through which the Soldiers paſs: Nor is the Law able to to remedy ſuch an inſupportable Grievance, becauſe it is not the Cuſtom in <hi>Poland</hi> to eſtabliſh Magazins and Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes in any place.</p>
               <pb n="166" facs="tcp:63304:93"/>
               <p>The Gentlemen who go to the Army, ſpend the beſt part of their Eſtates in furniſhing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Magnificent Arms, fine Horſes, and rich Apparel, maintaining a Numerous Train of Servants. Their Eſtates alone are not ſufficient to defray ſo vaſt a Charge; and beſides, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Pay for a conſiderable time after they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Service; ſo that they are, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, conſtrain'd to Oppreſs the People, that they may be able to ſupport their extravagant vanity. Some who are naturally of a leſs violent temper, endeavour to excuſe a Fault, which they are forc'd to acknowledge, by laying the blame upon the Court, pretending, that the King beſtows the Royal Gifts of the Republick, and the Offices and Dignities upon the Courtiers, or other great Lords, who either have no need of 'em, or do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve 'em, in ſtead of giving 'em to thoſe who have done good Service in the Army, where they have ſpent their Eſtates, and expos'd their Lives for the defence of their Country; Others accuſe thoſe who are entruſted with the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Finances,</hi> who make 'em wait very long for their Pay, and even then oblige 'em to quit part of it, that they may procure the reſt. Theſe Grievances exaſperate their Minds, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occaſion great Complaints in the <hi>Diet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they Levy Soldiers in <hi>Foland,</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains exact Contributions on thoſe Places where they Raiſe their Men, and give very little to the Soldiers, Retaining the Money they Receive on the Publick Account, always finding ſome unjuſt pretext to Defraud the Soldiers of their Pay, who are conſequently under a ſtrong Temptation, to Rob and Pillage the Country; the Officers not daring to Reſtrain a Diſorder which is occaſion'd by themſelves.</p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:63304:93"/>
               <p>To put a ſtop to theſe Irregularities, it has been frequently Propos'd to the <hi>Diets,</hi> by ſome Wiſe and Conſidering Perſons, to keep the Soldiers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Encamp'd, that they may be perpetually un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Strict Diſcipline, ready to oppoſe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and by that means kept from Pillaging and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining the Kingdom. And this Expedient wou'd doubtleſs be very agreeable and advantageous to the People, who could, with leſs trouble, Raiſe Money to Pay the Troops at Diſtance, than Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them at Home, and ſuffer all the Diſorders which they commit in their frequent Marches thro' the Countrey. This Remedy has been very much commended by ſome, but others are of opinion, that if the Soldiers were always kept in a Camp, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of one Officer, 'twon'd be a means to make the Generals of the Armies too Powerful. Thus the Soldiers continue to oppreſs the People, and harraſs the Kingdom, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Proſpect of Redreſs.</p>
               <p>I intimated before, that the want of Diſcipline, and the little Order that is obſerv'd among the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Troops, is the reaſon why they are oblig'd to Raiſe a New Army almoſt every Year; But the manner of Paying their Soldiers, which is neither every Week, nor every Moneth, nor every ſix Moneths, and ſometimes not at all, is a more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Fault, becauſe it keeps 'em under a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Temptation to Deſert; For when they are in the Army, they live upon <hi>Colewores, Roots, Fruits,</hi> which they find in the Woods, and on Horſe-fleſh when they can get it. It is not the Caſtom in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to give Ammunition-bread, ſo that the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are forc'd to let the Soldiers ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and conſequently, ſince the greateſt part of them are Starv'd, 'tis no wonder that they muſt raiſe a New Army every Year.</p>
               <pb n="168" facs="tcp:63304:94"/>
               <p>They Pay the Officers but once in the Year, and frequently but once in two years; and for that end they appoint Commiſſioners to meet at ſome place Remote from the Court, becauſe by a Conſtitution of the <hi>Diet,</hi> the King ought not to be preſent at the Meetings that are held for the Payment of the Soldiers, tho' every thing is done in his Name. The Commiſſioners that are deputed by the <hi>Diet,</hi> regulate the Payment of all the Officers, and uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally make ſome Abatement, eſpecially to Strangers. Nor muſt they be abſolutely blam'd for abridging the Pay of the Officers, becauſe they hardly lay out any Money for the Subſiſtance of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panys; whereas the Commiſſioners make up their Accounts as if they had entertain'd their Soldiers at their own Charges. 'Tis plain, the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Service is advantageous to the Officers, who are in a condition to wait ſome time for their Mony.</p>
               <p>The Army is uſually Paid but once in Two Years, and ſometimes the Republick is not able to Pay 'em then; which occaſions an univerſal Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring among the Soldiers, and obliges 'em ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to enter into a Confederacy, which they do in this manner. After the Officers have long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of the retaining of their Pay, and have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated to the Court, and to the <hi>Diet,</hi> that they can no longer ſubſiſt without it: and after they perceive that their Complaints and Remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are neglected, they aſſemble together, and make a <hi>Roko<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>z,</hi> which, in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Language, ſignifies a Separation from their Generals. The Subaltern Officers thus Aſſembled, chuſe Two of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, one for their Marſhal, and the other for his Licutenant: To theſe Officers, whom they call <hi>Subſtitutes,</hi> they take an Oath of Fidelity, to oblige the Republick to Pay 'em: After which the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal Commands this Confederate Army, as if he were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the General of it. 'Tis obvious to every
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:63304:94"/>conſidering Perſon, that ſuch a Revolt muſt be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Terrible Conſequenees; For then the Army, in ſtead of Marching towards the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, or Guarding the Frontiers, haraſſes the Country, and with an unbridled liberty over-runs the Eſtates of the Noblemen, making Neceſſity the Prtext of all the Diſorders they commit.</p>
               <p>The Danger of theſe Confederacies will appear, if we reflect upon the Violent Proceedings of the Confederate Army, of which <hi>Swiderski</hi> was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal, and <hi>Borzecki</hi> Subſtitute; which was not ſo much occaſion'd by want of Pay, as by the Parties that were form'd by ſome Perſons, who hop'd to Enrich themſelves during the General Diſorder, which cou'd not be quieted, without a great deal of trouble, at <hi>Leopold,</hi> by King <hi>John Caſimir,</hi> in the Year 1663.</p>
               <p>'Tis thus that the Army enters into a Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, tho' there is a Law, or Conſtitution, that whoſoever ſhall preſume to hold Meetings, make Harangues, raiſe Seditions, or enter into Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, ſhall be guilty of Death; and that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhall joyn the Confederates, ſhall be depriv'd of his Eſtate and Office.</p>
               <p>I have alſo obſerv'd another Defect in <hi>Poland,</hi> concerning the Office of the General of the Army, which is given for Life; ſo that 'tis not in the King's Power to Diſplace a General whom he has once Advanc'd, tho' he is often oblig'd to confer this Dignity upon ſome Great Lord, who is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly unacquainted with the Art of War. 'Tis not at all ſtrange then, that <hi>Poland</hi> ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſome Loſſes from time to time, and let ſlip ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Opportunities of weakning their Enemies; For they have more need, than any other Nation, of an Active and Experienc'd General, who knows how to manage the Soldiers, and will not keep them too long in a Place, where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:63304:95"/>Forage for the Horſe, nor Subſiſtance for the Foot; who will never engage his Troops in any place, from whence he cannot eaſily make good his Retreat; nor ever neglect an advantageous occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of giving Battle to his Enemy; and eſpecially one who knows, that a Numerous Army ought not to engage with a Small one in a narrow and cloſe place; becauſe, in ſuch a caſe, a handful of Men may beat a Formidable Army, as it appears, for Example, by the Inſtance of Marſhal <hi>Lubomir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski,</hi> who defeated the Vanguard of King <hi>John Caſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi>'s Army, at the Paſſage of <hi>Montroi;</hi> and of the <hi>Teutonick</hi> Knights, who, tho' much Inferior in Number to the Army of King <hi>Caſimir</hi> III. defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in a place, where King <hi>Caſimir</hi>'s Troops could not extend themſelves, nor put themſelves in Battalia. If therefore the <hi>Polanders</hi> had Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd Generals, they might, one Day, deſtroy all the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Infantry, for which they have had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Fair Opportunities; they might regain all that they have loſt, and even extend their Conqueſts far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But, to obtain this Advantage, the Office of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Army ought not to be given for Life, but only to Perſons of Merie, becauſe there is nothing that more animates the Courage of an Officer, than the hope of Higher Preferment; and there are more who aſpire to that Honour, when they may attain it by their own Merit, without expecting the Death of thoſe who poſſeſs it: And 'tis certain, that heretofore this Office was not given for Life in <hi>Poland,</hi> as 'tis at preſent. For <hi>John Tarnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ski</hi> was the firſt whom King <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> made Perpetual General of the Army of the Crown, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>serwards <hi>Nicholas Radziwill</hi> was advanc'd to the ſame Dignity in <hi>Lithuania.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is alſo in <hi>Poland</hi> another Diſorder among the Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> that they ſeldom come to the place of Rendezvous on the Day appointed; for
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63304:95"/>there are many of them who do not arrive there with their Companies, or Regiments, till a Moneth, and ſometimes Six weeks after: and even there are ſome who leave the Army a Moneth before the Campagne is ended. The King of <hi>Poland</hi> and the Generals might eaſily Remedy this Diſorder, but they dare not attempt to do it, for fear of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome Perſons of Quality, whoſe Affection they muſt carefully preſerve. For they who leave the Army, or come not to the Rendezvous by the Day prefixt, are commonly <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen, and not Strangers, who are more exact, and dare not aſſume ſuch Liberties without asking and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Leave.</p>
               <p>As 'tis impoſſible to carry on a War without Money, ſo there is no other way to Raiſe Mony but by Taxes. And therefore beſides the ordinary Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the Republick, which are the Fourth Part of the Eſtates and Offices that are in the King's Gift, The Cuſtoms upon Wines and Merchandizes, and the Tribute that is Exacted from the <hi>Jews,</hi> they impoſe alſo in time of Neceſſity a certain Sum, by way of Poll, upon every Perſon's Head, which is no new ſort of Tax in <hi>Poland:</hi> For King <hi>Caſimir</hi> III. after he had loſt the Battle againſt the <hi>Touto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick</hi> Knights, Summon'd a <hi>Diet</hi> at <hi>Peotrkow,</hi> in which it was ordain'd, That the whole Gentry and Clergy, and even the King Himſelf, ſhould give half of their Revenues for defraying the Charge of the War.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army is compos'd of <hi>Polanders</hi> and Strangers: All the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Troops are Cavalry, and are called <hi>Huſartsz,</hi> and <hi>Tovarzyſz.</hi> The <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſartsz</hi> are Choſen Men, Brave, and in good Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The <hi>Tovarzysz</hi> are ſo called from a word which ſignifies a <hi>Comerade,</hi> and both ſorts are Gentlemen; The one are Armed with Lances, and the other with Bows and Arrows; and there are
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63304:96"/>ſome Troops of Horſe, who have behind their Backs Wings made of Cocks Feathers, which are uſually White, in order to frighten the Enemies Horſes, which are not accuſtom'd to ſuch ſights. They are all Richly Cloath'd with the Skins of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Leopards,</hi> or <hi>Panthers:</hi> their Horſes are alſo very ſine, and well-harneſſed. In a word, it may be ſaid, that they are the fineſt and beſt Cavalry in the World; and that they would be Invincible if they were more ſubmiſſive, and better Paid.</p>
               <p>As for the Foreign Troops, they are almoſt all Infantry, and are called Forreigners, becauſe they are kept on <hi>German</hi> Pay, and receive the Word of Command in the <hi>German</hi> Language, tho' moſt of the Soldiers and Officers are <hi>Polanders.</hi> Thoſe Troops are divided into Regiments of Foot, or Dragoons, and the Regiments into Companys, as in <hi>France;</hi> But the Soldiers are ſo miſerably poor, that the greateſt part of them have neither Swords nor Shooes. When they lie in Towns, they live on Three <hi>Gros</hi> a day, which are worth Two pence of <hi>Poliſh</hi> Money, or a Penny <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and upon what they can ſteal from the Peaſants that come that come to the Markets; for 'tis not the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome in <hi>Poland</hi> to give them Ammunition-bread; and even the Officers of Foot are not better Cloath'd than our common Soldiers.</p>
               <p>I proceed, in the next place, to give ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Equipage with which the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> go to the Army: And firſt, There are no <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>utlers in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army; for, beſides that, the Soldiers would not pay 'em, they could never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive in the Camp without being plunder'd by the Soldiers, and eſpecially by the <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> who are more accuſtom'd to Pillage than the <hi>Polanders;</hi> ſo that every Man muſt carry every thing that he ſtands in need of along with him; which obliges the Officers to hare a great Equipage, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63304:96"/>ſufficient quantities of Meat, Bacon, Butter, Salt, Sugar, Comfits, Spices, Beer, Hungary-Wine, Brandy, Oats, and generally of every thing that is neceſſary for themſelves, their Servants, and their Horſes: They have many Wagons, as well for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying all ſorts of Proviſions, as their Tents, which are very heavy, but very fine. As for the poor Soldiers, I have already intimated, that they live upon Roots, and the fleſh of dead Horſes, or ſuch as they find lying in Quagmires. For if the Owner does not take ſpeedy care to draw him out, he muſt expect to be prevented by the Famiſh'd Soldiers, who, in a moment, cut him into a Thouſand Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>'Tis generally known and acknowledg'd, that the ſucceſs of an Enterprize, eſpeially in War, depends in a particular manner upon two things, <hi>viz.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, and the Certain Knowledge which a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ought to have of the ſtrength or weakneſs of his Enemies, and of the place where they are poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As for Secrecy, which is the Soul of all Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Affairs; it is ſo little obſerv'd in <hi>Poland,</hi> that every petty Officer is acquainted with all the Great General's Deſigns: And as for the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the State of the Enemy, ſince the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> never make uſe of Spyes, they never learn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny News of the Enemy's Army, till they meet with ſome of their Parties. And this is the reaſon why the News which come from the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army are ſo uncertain, that thoſe who are acquainted with the Country, ſeldom give any Credit to theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports.</p>
               <p>The Army of <hi>Poland</hi> being thus Compos'd, and being accompany'd with ſuch an Equipage as I late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mention'd, is under the Command of a Great General, and of the General of the Field; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe Two General Officers, there are alſo others under them, as the Maſter of the Artillery,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:63304:97"/>the <hi>Piſſarſz,</hi> or Intendant of the Army, the Great Standard-Bearer, the Field-Marſhal, the General of the Centinels, and the Major-Generals, who are the ſame with our Brigadiers.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, there is one thing more obſervable in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army, which is, that if News be brought to them, when they are at Table, that the Enemy appears, they will not ſtir till they have done, to Mount their Horſes, and purſue their Enemies.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXII. <hi>Of the</hi> Eſtates <hi>and</hi> Revenues <hi>of the</hi> Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</head>
               <p>THE Eſtates in <hi>Poland</hi> are of Three ſorts, either Royal, Eccleſiaſtick, or Patrimonial. The Royal Eſtates are part of the Domain, and belong to the Republick. They conſiſt of the <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſties, Salt-works,</hi> and half the Revenue of the Port of <hi>Dantzick.</hi> As for the <hi>Staroſties,</hi> the King is oblig'd to beſtow them on <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Six Months after a Vacancy; for 'tis not in his Power to reſerve any of them for himſelf, except thoſe that are called Royal Oeconomies, which, together with the <hi>Salt-works,</hi> and the Port of <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick,</hi> belong properly to him; ſo that his whole Revenue amounts to but about a Million of Livers. But then he is not to pay any Troops out of it, not ſo ſo much as his own Regiment of Guards; and all the Officers of his Houſhould, who are Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſerve him without any Salary, in hopes of obtaining ſome Benefice, or <hi>Staroſtie.</hi> So that he is at no Charge but for his Table, Cloaths,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63304:97"/>and Stable; and beſides, he receives many Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of Fleſh, Fiſh, Stuffs, hay and Oats.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Staroſties</hi> ought only to be given to old Officers, who have ſerv'd long time in the Army, and are, as it were, Super-annuated: for the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Word <hi>Staroſc,</hi> ſignifies old Age; and he who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys one of thoſe Eſtates, is call'd <hi>Staroſta,</hi> from <hi>Stary,</hi> which ſignifies an Old Man. There are Two ſorts of <hi>Staroſties;</hi> ſome are empower'd to exerciſe a Juriſdiction thro' the whole extent of their Territory, whereas there are others without any Juriſdiction: The firſt are the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, tho' they are not always the Richeſt. Each <hi>Staroſta</hi> is oblig'd to give the fourth part of the Revenue of his <hi>Staroſtie</hi> to the Republick; and no Man can poſſeſs Two of thoſe who have Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The King may beſtow the Reverſion of a <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſtie</hi> upon the <hi>Staroſta</hi>'s Wife, except in <hi>Rúſſia,</hi> which is a Frontier Province; for ſince a <hi>Staroſtie</hi> is a Government, the Republick ſuppoſes that the Governor ought to reſide upon the place: but <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen may be made Governours of Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier Places, becauſe the Republick relies more upon their Fidelity than upon that of Forreigners; tho' they are ſometimes deceiv'd in this Maxim; For he who ſurrender'd the City of <hi>Caminiec</hi> to the <hi>Turks,</hi> without making any Reſiſtance, was not only a Gentleman of <hi>Poland,</hi> but even a <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Salt-works</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> the moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable are thoſe of <hi>Vieluczka</hi> and <hi>Boehinia,</hi> about Five Leagues from <hi>Cracow;</hi> which yields about 400000 Livres Yearly: They were found out in the Year 1252. They reſemble deep Mines dug in the Earth, to which they deſcend by a hole, like to that of a Quarry. The Workmen, who are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in Digging out the Salt, begin to enter the Pits at Midnight, and thoſe who go down firſt,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:63304:98"/>begin to come out about Noon, becauſe they muſt be let down, and drawn up with a great Rope, like that with which large Stones are rais'd up out of <hi>Quarries.</hi> As they dig the <hi>Salt</hi> out of the Mines, they muſt leave great Pillars from place to place, to ſupport the Earth: and ſince theſe Vaulted Pits are all cover'd with <hi>Salt,</hi> when one goes down into them, he ſeems to be ſurrounded with a Thouſand Cryſtals, which reflect the Light of the Torches. There are ſome parts of 'em dug ſo far, that it would be dangerous to go into 'em, becauſe one might eaſily loſe himſelf in theſe Labyrinths. The <hi>Salt</hi> is taken out in large Columns, which being looſen'd from the Mine, are drawn by Horſes juſt under the Mouth of the Pit, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards drawn up like Stones out of a Quarry. The Horſes continue always in thoſe Subterranean Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, but the Men come out every day; and (which is very remarkable, there is a Spring of Sweet Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the <hi>Salt-pits,</hi> of which both the Men and Horſes drink.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Salt</hi> is brought out of the Pits, they carry thoſe great Pieces, or Columns, through the whole Kingdom, except <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> where they only uſe <hi>French Salt.</hi> Before the <hi>Poliſh Salt</hi> can be us'd, it muſt be beaten to pieces, and then ground in a Mill. Beſides theſe Pits of <hi>Bochnia</hi> and <hi>Vieluczka,</hi> there are other <hi>Salt-works</hi> at <hi>Halicz</hi> in <hi>Pokutia</hi> on the <hi>Neiſter,</hi> at <hi>Kolomey</hi> in the ſame Province, on the River <hi>Prut,</hi> and at <hi>Pinsk,</hi> a City of <hi>Lithuania</hi> in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſia;</hi> and beſides theſe, there are ſome others which belong to private Men; for there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Law, that the Republick ſhall not pretend a Right to the Mines of Salt, or of any Metals which are found in any Gentleman's Lands. There is alſo White Salt made in many other places of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as in the <hi>Palatinat</hi> of <hi>Craeow,</hi> between <hi>Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiecin,</hi> upon the <hi>Viſtula,</hi> and Mount <hi>Crapat;</hi> But
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63304:98"/>this Salt is for the King's uſe; beſides, they make great quantities of Salt in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> by Boiling Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, which coſts 'em little, becauſe that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince is all cover'd with Woods.</p>
               <p>There are alſo ſome Mines of Lead mixt with Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the Burroughs of <hi>Ilkuſch, Slankow, Kranow</hi> and <hi>Nowoguiia,</hi> which are in the <hi>Palatinat</hi> of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow;</hi> and in that of <hi>Sandomir</hi> there is <hi>Salt-peter</hi> at <hi>Vieliczca;</hi> there is alſo <hi>Vitriol</hi> found at <hi>Byecz,</hi> and <hi>Quickſilver</hi> at <hi>Tuſtan</hi> in <hi>Pokutia</hi> towards the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
               <p>The Eccleſiaſtick Eſtates are the Benefices, as Biſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricks, Abbacy's, Priory's, Canonſhips, Curacies, and all the Lands that are poſſeſs'd by the Regular Clergy. The Benefices are not ſo numerous as in <hi>France,</hi> for there are but Sixteen Biſhopricks, and ſome Abbacy's: But the Biſhopricks are of a great extent, and endow'd with large Revenues, ſome of theſe Prelates having above 100000 Livers Yearly Rent.</p>
               <p>The Patrimonial Eſtates belong properly to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> whether the Right of Succeſſion be by Purchaſe, or Inheritance, and conſiſt in Houſes, Lands, Towns, Villages, Lakes, Mills, Meadows and Woods, but eſpecially in Peaſants; for a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's Riches are valu'd by the Number of his Peaſants, every one of them being worth 100 <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres</hi> a Year to his Maſter. Theſe Peaſants are Slaves, and cannot poſſeſs any thing: all that they heap together belongs to their Lord, whom they cannot leave without his permiſſion, unleſs they turn Prieſts or Fryers: But theſe miſerable Wretches work ſo hard, without intermiſſion, that they have no time to ſtudy, in order to fit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeives for admittance among the Secular or Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Clergy, except only in the quality of Lay-Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen take alſo care to prevent, by obliging them to Marry young,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63304:99"/>that they may not be receiv'd into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</p>
               <p>To ſettle a Peaſant upon a Piece of Land, or in a Village, the Lord cauſes a Cottage of Wood to be built for him, and gives him Two little Horſes, one Cow, ſome Hens, Geeſe and Rye to ſubſiſt upon for a Year. In the mean time he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points a certain Piece of Ground in the Village, which the Peaſant is oblig'd to Till for his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, and upon which he is to maintain himſelf for the future; for all the Goods of the Village belong to the Lord. The ſettling of a Peaſant coſts a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman nothing but the price which he pays for him; Becauſe the other Peaſants of the Village build the Houſe, and furniſh the Cattel, Poultry, and all that he gives to his new Subject, who, with his Wife and Children is oblig'd to work Four days in the Week for his Maſter, and to ſpend the other Two days in Tilling the Ground which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him for his Subſiſtance.</p>
               <p>When Harveſt comes, all the Peaſants of the Village go out together to cut down, and gather in the Corn for their Lord, who appoints certain Perſons to Overſee their Work, and to beat 'em when they are idle. For the Puniſhment of the Peaſants there is a ſort of Pillory in every Village, on which thoſe Miſerable Wretches are ſometimes forc'd to ſtand a whole day.</p>
               <p>One would think the Peaſants in <hi>Poland</hi> ſhould reckon themſelves the moſt unhappy Creatures in the World, to ſee themſelves reduc'd to perpetual Slavery, and oblig'd to Work continually, without the proſpect of one day of reſt: But they do not ſo much as know that there are any Perſons of their condition happier than they; for when they are young, they ſee their Fathers treated after the ſame manner: And beſides, they have this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that they never want Proviſions. Their
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63304:99"/>Wives are employ'd almoſt in nothing elſe than Dreſſing their Meat, of which they have uſually 3 or 4 ſorts every day for Dinner, <hi>viz.</hi> a Diſh of Peaſe with a little Bacon, another of Oatmeal, Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Millet, or of the Grain which they call <hi>Cachat,</hi> and the reſt of ſeveral ſorts of Roots, which they have in abundance, and very good.</p>
               <p>The Furniture of their Houſes conſiſts of ſome Earthen, or Wooden Diſhes, and a Bed, which they make of Chaff and Feathers, with a ſort of Coverlet over it. As for their Children, they never lye in Beds till they are Marry'd, but upon Boards round the Floor, which they uſe in many places in ſtead of an Oven, to Bake their Bread, and to Boil their little pots of <hi>Cachat</hi> and Roots. Theſe Stoves have no Chimney to let out the Smoak, ſo that their Huts are always full of a Thick Smoak, which has no other paſſage but a ſmall Window a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Four Foot from the Ground. When they go into their Cottages, they are forc'd to ſtoop, that they may not be ſtiff'd with the Smoak which is ſo thick above the little Window, that one cannot ſee the Roof; and yet 'tis impoſſible to go to Bed in the Winter without Stoves, ſo that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have them in their Houſes as well as the Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants; But thoſe in Gentlemens Houſes are neatly made of Burnt Earth, like fine Earthen Veſſels, with a Chimney to let out the Smoak.</p>
               <p>The Children of the Peaſants, eſpecially in <hi>Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> go ſtark Naked, as well the Girls as the Boys, till they are Four or Five years of Age. They are never taught to go, but, as ſoon as they have got a little ſtrength, the Mother ſets them down at the Threſhold of the Door, where they learn, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, to Crawl along, and get up by themſelves, and when they are dirty, the Mother Waſhes them in cold Water, which makes 'em ſo hardy, that I have ſeen 'em slide Bare-footed on the Ice.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:63304:100"/>
               <p>The Peaſants are Cloath'd in Winter with a Waſtcoat of Sheep's-Skins with the Wool; and in Summer they wear a Stuff Coat of a Chimney-Sweeper's Colour, with an ugly ſort of Cap or Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net. Sometimes they wear Boots, but moſt uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Shooes, which they make of the Bark of a Tree. As for the Women, their Habits are not much different from thoſe of the Country-Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>France;</hi> only their Smocks are ſo ſhort, that one may ſometimes ſee their Skin between their Waſtcoat and Petticoat. In <hi>Ruſſia</hi> the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men go all Summer in their Smocks with an Apron before them, the Strings of which ſerve them for a Girdle, but their Smocks reach to their Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leg.</p>
               <p>They never Build a Houſe in <hi>Poland</hi> without a Stove in each Room: Some of the Gentlemens Houſes are of Wood, and others of Brick; and all ſo contriv'd, that they Lodge only in the Lower Rooms, except in ſome Houſes in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. The Gentlemen, by reaſon of the frequent Incurſions of the <hi>Tartars,</hi> have but very little Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and that of no great value: for they have only little Beds with Taffeta Curtains, and ſome <hi>Turkey</hi> Carpets. They have no more Beds than what are ſufficient for their own Family; ſo that when one goes to Viſit them, he muſt either carry a Bed along with him, or reſolve to lye upon the Floor.</p>
               <p>Moſt of their Countrey-Houſes are of Wood, without Fountains, Gardens or Avenues, becauſe the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen take no delight in Planting Trees upon their Lands, tho 'tis certain <hi>Poland</hi> would be a very fit Countrey for Fruit-Trees, and eſpecially for Apples and Pears, for in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they grow wild, and proſper to Admiration; ſo that they might have very good Sider, which would ſave them a great deal of Corn, which they
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63304:100"/>conſume in Beer; But they take very little pains either to Improve their Lands, or Increaſe their Revenues.</p>
               <p>There are many Great Lake both in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> with Mills upon them, for Grinding of Meal and <hi>Cachat.</hi> But I never ſaw any Mills for Paper, Cloath, or Leather, tho they might eaſily have them, and conſequently ſave all the Money which Forreigners gain by the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of theſe Commodities. But the <hi>Polanders</hi> not only deſerve to be Cenſur'd for not embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Houſes by Planting Trees about 'em, and Augmenting their Revenues by erecting New Mills; but are even ſo little mindful of their Intereſt, that they neglect ſome Advantageous Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which would coſt 'em nothing but the Labour of their Peaſants.</p>
               <p>They have vaſt Fens and Moraſſes, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently might have a great deal of Paſturage, ſo that they might breed and bring up abundance of Cattel, which would be extreamly advantageous to them; for I neither know, nor ever heard of a Country in which there is more Fleſh eaten than in <hi>Poland,</hi> and conſequently where there are more Cattel kill'd; nor is there any place in the World where they uſe greater quantities of Leather: for every body wears Boots, and almoſt all the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have Coaches, or Waggons cover'd with Leather, which they call <hi>Ridevans.</hi> Nevertheleſs in ſtead of preparing the Hides and Skins of the Cattel which they kill, they ſuffer Strangers to carry 'em away into their own Countrys, where they Prepare them, and afterwards make the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> Pay dear for that which they Sold for a Trifle.</p>
               <p>There are many Lakes in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania</hi> ſo large, that it would be almoſt impoſſible to Drain them. Theſe Lakes abound with Fiſh,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63304:101"/>which the <hi>Polanders</hi> uſually take in the Winter. When the Ice is pretty ſtrong they make a great Hole to let down their Nets, and afterwards make ſeveral ſmaller holes, from ſpace to ſpace, that they may draw their Nets along from hole to hole, with a Rope which is faſten'd to a long Pole, till they bring them back to the firſt large Opening. When the two ends of the Nets are brought together, they pull them out, and bring up with them all the Fiſhes that happen'd to be in that ſpace of Water through which the Nets were drawn, for they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not leap over the Nets becauſe of the Ice. The Fiſhes thrive ſo well in thoſe Great Lakes, that there are an infinite number of Pikes, Four Foot long, and Carps Two and a half.</p>
               <p>The whole Countrey of <hi>Poland</hi> is full of Woods, and <hi>Lithuania</hi> much more: And there are ſome Foreſts ſo large, that it would require, at leaſt, a whole Day to paſs from one ſide to the other. The Revenue of thoſe Foreſts, which, for the moſt part are Firr-Trees, does not conſiſt in the Sale of the Wood, but in the gathering in of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Wax, which they find in the Hollow Trunks of the Trees, in ſo great quantity, that in many Places it yields above 10000 <hi>Livres</hi> a Year. There is ſo much Honey in <hi>Poland,</hi> and eſpecially in <hi>Lithuania,</hi> that they make a ſort of Wine or <hi>Mead</hi> of it, which they uſe for their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Drink. 'Tis ſaid, that in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> which lies more Northwards, there is a much greater a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Honey, which ſupplies the defect of Wine and Beer, and enables 'em to ſubſiſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably in their Cold Habitations.</p>
               <p>'Tis ſtrange that there ſhould be ſuch vaſt ſwarms of Bees in ſo cold a Countrey, ſince 'tis obſerv'd, that theſe Animals are more delighted with the Flowers that are found in hot Countreys, than with thoſe that grow in a Cold Climate. It muſt
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63304:101"/>be concluded then, that the Bees find ſome agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Liquor upon the Firr-Trees, and that they are pleaſed with that ſort of Wood; which the <hi>Polanders</hi> have very well obſerv'd; for all the Hives which they have in their Gardens are made of the Hollow Trunks of Firr-Trees.</p>
               <p>I proceed in the next place to ſhow how the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gentlemen Improve their Eſtates, and how they raiſe their Revenues. It is not the Cuſtom in this Countrey to let Eſtates for Money, except only the Farms of <hi>Beer, Brandy,</hi> and the Inns which they call <hi>Karczma:</hi> All the other Rents are paid in <hi>Corn,</hi> which they ſend to <hi>Dantzick</hi> to be Sold, in <hi>Fiſh,</hi> which is bought by the Merchants, in <hi>Horſes, Oxen, Cowes, Calves, Sheep, Hogs, Ceeſe, Ducks, Turkey Hens, Common Hens, Chickens</hi> and <hi>Capons,</hi> which the Peaſants very carefully bring up, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to eat, or ſell any of 'em, or otherwiſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezel them, for fear of the Rod. As for the <hi>But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Eggs,</hi> after the Landlord's Kitchen is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently furniſh'd, he beſtows the reſt, with the Flax which the Peaſants make, upon his Wife, which ſhe ſells for Pocket-Money; for the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in <hi>Poland</hi> are not ſuffer'd to keep the Purſe; but when they want any thing they pray their Husband to give it them, embracing his Knees, and calling him, <hi>My Patron,</hi> or <hi>Benefactor.</hi> The Men do all the Buſineſs, and the Women meddle with nothing but Eating, Drinking and Dancing, there being orders given in the Kitchen to give them whatever they demand.</p>
               <p>Upon every Mannor the Lord keeps a <hi>Pod Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſta,</hi> that is, an inferior Gentleman, who takes care to gather in the Cattle and other Rents from the Peaſants, to ſend part of 'em into his Maſter's Kitchen, and to ſell the reſt. But tho' there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be an exact Computation made of the Revenue of Land in <hi>Poland,</hi> becauſe conſiſts almoſt whol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63304:102"/>in Commodities, a conſiderable part of which is conſumed in the Landlord's Houſe; there are Perſons of Quality whoſe Yearly Revenue is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd to amount to more than 100000 Crowns. And formerly the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentry were ſo Rich, that ſome Lords uſually came to the <hi>Diets</hi> with a Train of above 1000 Men; and others, upon preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing occaſions, have furniſh'd the Republick with 3000 Men, rais'd at their own Charge, as did <hi>Leo Sapieha</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> after the great Defeat of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army at <hi>Pilaveze</hi> in <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania,</hi> on the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> 1648.</p>
               <p>But at preſent <hi>Poland</hi> is not ſo Rich, becauſe it is not ſo well Peopled as formerly. Nor can it be reaſonably ſuppos'd to be either ſo Rich or Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, after it has been harraſs'd by ſo many Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the <hi>Muſcovites, Turks, Tartars</hi> and <hi>Coſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,</hi> who have, at ſeveral times, carry'd away an infinite number of Slaves; and after the Bloody and Expenſive Wars which the Republick has main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd againſt all its Neighbours; And beſides, the Plague which ſucceeded theſe Deſolations, has Contributed, in a great meaſure, to Diſpeople part of the Countrey.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIII. <hi>Of the</hi> Cuſtoms, Humour, <hi>and</hi> Inclinations <hi>of the</hi> Polanders.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Polanders</hi> are naturally ſo extremely deſirous of Money, that they are willing to ſubmit to any terms to procure it. But thoſe who are acquainted with their Temper, will never give them more than what they intend to loſe; for it is not their Cuſtom to Pay their Debts,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63304:102"/>nor ſo much as to return a Civil Anſwer to their Creditors.</p>
               <p>Since it may ſeem incredible that any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce can ſubſiſt among a People, who never Pay what they Borrow; it will not be improper to give an Account of the way of Lending Money in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> for Bonds and Obligations are of no uſe in this Countrey. Thoſe who want Money, muſt either procure a Supply from the Gentlemen, Merchants or Burgeſſes: When one Gentleman ſends Money to another, the Borrower Mortgages or makes over a Village to his Creditor, till the Money be Re-paid.</p>
               <p>As for the Burgeſſes and Merchants, they never lend Money to the Gentlemen, but upon Pledges, at 14 <hi>per cent.</hi> Intereſt, as 'tis allow'd by the Laws of the Kingdoms. There is a Note, or Inventory ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Quantity and Kind of the Pledges, which the Borrower gives to the perſon who Lends the Money; and if they conſiſt of Jewels, as for example, a Pearl-Necklace, it is Seal'd at the two ends with the Borrower's Seal. In the ſame Note, after both the Quantity and Value of the Jewels, or Plate that is Pawn'd, and the Sum of Money that is Lent are ſpecify'd, the Borrower obliges himſelf to Pay the Money at Six Months Warning, and in the mean time to pay Intereſt at the rate of 14 <hi>per Cent.</hi> 'Tis alſo ſtipulated and agreed upon betwixt both Parties, that if the Borrower ſhall neglect to pay Intereſt for the ſpace of Three years, the Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor ſhall, in that caſe, have full Power to ſend them to <hi>Dantzick</hi> to be Sold: And this is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way that the Merchants and Burgers Lend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to the <hi>Polanders,</hi> for otherwiſe they would never be paid.</p>
               <p>Tho 'tis certain, that the <hi>Polanders</hi> are paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate lovers of Money, and will leave no means unattempted to procure it; 'tis no leſs certain
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63304:103"/>that they do not deſire it to Purchaſe Lands, or to Build Fine Houſes, or encreaſe their Revenues; but only to buy Silks, Stuffs, Furs, Fine Horſes and Arms, and, above all, good <hi>Hungarian</hi> Wine.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen are all naturally civil. They uſually invite Travellers to their Houſes, and Entertain them in a very kind and obliging manner. The Great Lords are very Generous and Magnificent: and, to my certain knowledge, ſome of them have taken into their Houſes <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Italians</hi> and <hi>Germans,</hi> and Maintain'd them, till they found ſome Employment. I know parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, that that Chancellor <hi>Patz</hi> has given both Horſes and Money to Strangers, who had done him no Service at all.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polanders</hi> are generally very fond of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Habits after their Mode: Moſt of them wear very handſom Boots, the heels of which are ſhod with Iron, a Furr'd Cap, and Veſts that reach to their Mid-leg, and are Furred in Cold Weather. The Great Lords have them Furr'd with Sable, which is brought them from <hi>Muſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> and the reſt with the Skins of <hi>Tygres, Leopards, Panthers,</hi> &amp;c. Some of the Fine Furs coſt above 1000 Crowns, but they are only worn at <hi>Diets,</hi> and are kept from Father to Son.</p>
               <p>Some, though few, are Cloathed after the <hi>French</hi> Faſhion, and wear Linnen, Lace, Point, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rukes and Swords: for thoſe who retain the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Habit wear no other Linnen but Shirts and Drawers, and ſome of them Socks. The ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Gentlemen, and even ſome of the Great Lords, cauſe ſome bruiſed Chaff to be put into the Feet of their Boots, which ſerves them for a Sole, and for Socks: But I ſpeak only of the Gentry, for the Peaſants wear no Linnen at all, unleſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps a Shirt of Courſe Cloath.</p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:63304:103"/>
               <p>The <hi>Polanders</hi> cut their Hair above their Ears, and Shave their Faces, leaving only one large Whisker. They walk gravely with a Pole-ax in their hand, and a Sword by their ſide, which they never lay aſide but when they go to Bed; for they wear it even when they go to Confeſſion, and when they Receive the Sacrament. The Sword hangs at a Thong of Leather to which their Handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is faſten'd, with a Knife in a Sheath, and a ſmall Stone, ſet in Silver, to Whet their Knife on; every Morning they Waſh their Face and Neck with cold Water, even in the ſharpeſt Weather. This Cuſtom is ſo generally obſerv'd among them, that the Fathers make their Children Waſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as ſoon as they riſe.</p>
               <p>Almoſt all the Women of Quality Dreſs after the <hi>French</hi> Mode, eſpecially thoſe who frequent the Court, and even the Oldeſt of 'em are very careful to adorn themſelves, and wear Red Clothes. They are extreamly fond of Fine Clothes, Modiſh Silks, Laces, Points, Ribbons, Hoods, Gloves, fine Shooes, and generally every thing that is brought from <hi>France,</hi> which they uſually buy very dear. For provided they be not oblig'd to pay ready Money, they are willing to promiſe whatever is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; ſo that the <hi>French</hi> Merchants, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find a way to recover their Money, grow quickly Rich, for they ſell Ribbans for a Crown a Yard, which coſt 'em but 15 Pence at <hi>Paris,</hi> tho' the Ell in <hi>Poland</hi> is but half a <hi>French</hi> Ell.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polanders</hi> are ſo much in love with Splendor, that the Ladies never go abroad but in a Coach drawn by Six Horſes, even tho' they only intend to croſs the Street, and to go to a Church over againſt their Houſes. When the Lords or Ladies go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad at Night, they have 24 Flambeaus of White Wax carry'd before their Coach. The Ladies Trains are frequently held up by Dwarfs, who
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:63304:104"/>are born of Fathers and Mothers of a very large ſtature. The Ladies are always attended by an Old Woman, whom they call <hi>Majordome.</hi> The Gentleman-Uſher, who ought to Lead them under the Arm, is an Old Gentleman, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows them on foot, and never goes into the Coach; but the Horſes go very ſoftly. This Cuſtom does not proceed from the Jealouſy of the Husbands, for they neither do, nor have any reaſon to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect their Wives, becauſe the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ladies are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Modeſt, and not at all Coquettes, tho they have as much Liberty as in <hi>France;</hi> but ordinary Women are not ſo nicely vertuous, eſpecially the Maids, who think it no Scandal to their Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be Unmarry'd Mothers, nor is their Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty any hindrance to their Fortune. They uſually ſerve as Nurſes; for a Marry'd Woman, tho ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo poor, will not Nurſe any Child but her own.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the Extream Coldneſs of the Climate, they are ſo much addicted to Bathing, that there is no Gentleman's Houſe without a Bath. There are alſo Publick Baths in every Town for the Common People: The Ladies and their Daughters Bath once a Month. 'Tis an Univerſal Cuſtom thro the Whole Countrey to Bath their Infants twice a Day, till they are Two years old; This is probably the Reaſon why the <hi>Polanders</hi> are not ſubject to Scabbineſs in the Face or Head. The Children are never heard to Cry, becauſe they are not Swath'd, but only wrapt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with Linnen Clouts, and conſequently have room enough to move their Bodies; whereas in <hi>France</hi> they are in a manner Fetter'd with Cords; And becauſe there are ſometimes Girls to be ſeen in this Country, whoſe Stature is ſpoil'd, which ſome might attribute to the neglect of Swathing 'em in their Infancy; I ſhall take this occaſion
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63304:104"/>to obſerve, that all the Men are very large and well-ſhap'd, and that the ordinary Girls are not ſubject to that inconveniency; ſo that we may reaſonably ſuppoſe, that the Stature of ſome Girls of Quality is only ſpoil'd by their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, who put 'em in Cloathes too ſoon, after the <hi>French</hi> Mode, or becauſe they gird them too cloſe, and know not how to Dreſs them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polanders</hi> bear the loſs of their Eſtates, and all other Diſaſters, with ſo much Courage and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, that they ſeem to be inſenſible: And as they endure their own Misfortunes with ſo little Concern, they have no Compaſſion for the Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of others. Their Cities being, for the moſt part, Built of Wood, which frequently takes Fire; they will ſtand very quietly to ſee a Houſe Burn, without making the leaſt Motion to extinguiſh the Fire. And even there is ſo little Tenderneſs in their Tempers, that neither the Fathers take care to Ranſom their Children, nor the Children their Fathers, who are carry'd away Slaves into <hi>Tartary.</hi> It cannot be ſuppos'd that ſuch a Nation as this regards the condition of other Kingdoms: And indeed they are ſo far from concerning themſelves with the Affairs of Forreigners; that tho the whole Chriſtian World were engag'd in an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal War, they would not ſo much as offer their Mediation to Negotiate a Peace.</p>
               <p>They neither learn to Ride, Fence, nor Dance in <hi>Poland,</hi> becauſe they have no <hi>Academies.</hi> And, for this Reaſon the young Lords are generally much addicted to Travelling, that they may learn the Languages and Exerciſes that are Taught in Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Countreys; Nevertheleſs, thoſe who ſtay at home, Ride, Fence, and Dance after their own Faſhion, and without conſtraint; for the <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> are naturally inclin'd to ſuch Exerciſes, and are all paſſionate Lovers of Dancing and Muſick.
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:63304:105"/>The very Nurſes teach the Children to Dance as ſoon as they begin to go, and you may frequently ſee Two little Children Dancing to the Voice of a Nurſe, or Servant; and Peaſants Playing upon the Violin, while they are bringing a Boat laden with Corn along the <hi>Viſtula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis certain, that the <hi>Polanders</hi> would be Invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, if they were Well-Diſciplin'd, for they are ſo harden'd, and enur'd to Fatigues, that they look upon the <hi>Germans</hi> as a ſoft and effeminate Nation, who are not able to endure the Toil of War, and the exceſſive rigour of the Winter. The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army has oftentimes Encamp'd in the Snow, and particularly in the Year 1663. King <hi>Caſimir</hi> ſet out from <hi>Leopold</hi> in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and Led His Army to the Frontiers of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> where he Encamp'd all the Winter, and did not Retire till the next Spring.</p>
               <p>Before I conclude this Chapter, I muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Two Diſtempers that are peculiar to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> of which one is called the <hi>Roſe,</hi> and the other the <hi>Plica.</hi> The <hi>Roſe</hi> is a ſort of <hi>Eryſipela,</hi> which chiefly breaks out in the Face. The <hi>Polanders</hi> Cure this Diſeaſe by applying Powder of Chalk to the part, without Letting Blood; for they fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that Bleeding would prove Mortal in that caſe. The <hi>Plica</hi> is a Twiſting of the Hair, in ſuch a manner, that 'tis impoſſible to unravel it. Theſe Twiſted Locks cannot be compar'd to any thing more fitly, than to thoſe long and naſty Ropes of Hair upon ſome <hi>Spaniels.</hi> The <hi>Polanders</hi> give this Account of the Original of this Diſtemper: They ſay, That the <hi>Tartars</hi> having made a Furious Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption into <hi>Poland,</hi> in the Year 1279, and having killed a great Number of People, they Poyſon'd their Hearts, and threw 'em into the Waters, which Infected thoſe who drunk 'em with this
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63304:105"/>Loathſome Diſeaſe, the True Cauſe whereof is ſtill a Secret to <hi>Phyſitians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Strangers generally believe, that the <hi>Plica</hi> is the effect of Slovenlineſs, and not of any Diſtemper: and they are confirm'd in this Opinion, becauſe they are never troubled with it, even tho they live a long time in the Countrey; for if their Hair begins to Twiſt when they fall Sick, they cauſe it immediately to be Cut off, which the <hi>Polanders</hi> dare not do, for fear of loſing their Sight, which they imagin is an unavoidable conſequence of Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off the Hair in this Diſtemper. Yet I have known ſome, whoſe Hair was actually Cut off without any dangerous Accident. But the People are ſo perſwaded that the <hi>Plica</hi> is a Diſtemper, that there are ſome Old Women who pretend to bring it out upon Children that are troubled with Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Diſeaſes, by mixing and twiſting their Hair, and making their Mothers believe, that the Children are only Sick, becauſe the <hi>Plica</hi> cannot break forth.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. <hi>Of the</hi> Religion <hi>of the</hi> Polanders.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Polanders</hi> Received the <hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Mieceſlaus,</hi> in the Year 964. and have ever ſince remain'd in Subjection to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> except ſome, who, in the laſt Age Embrac'd the Doctrins of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin.</hi> At preſent the <hi>Polanders</hi> are generally <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks,</hi> except in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> where there are ſtill a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number of Perſons who obſerve the Rites of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church; and in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> where there are many <hi>Lutherans,</hi> as at <hi>Dantzick, Elbing,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63304:106"/>Thorn,</hi> and <hi>Mariemburg.</hi> There were alſo ſome <hi>Socinian</hi> formerly, but King <hi>John Caſimir</hi> Expell'd 'em out of the Kingdom in 1658, and oblig'd 'em to ſell their Eſtates in Three years.</p>
               <p>In the Reign of <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus, Nicholas Radziwill</hi> was the firſt who turned <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> and Protected thoſe of that Perſwaſion in his Houſe at <hi>Vilna,</hi> where they Sung the <hi>Pſalms</hi> Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into the Vulgar Tongue. But that Branch of the Houſe of <hi>Radziwill</hi> is now wholly Extinct, the laſt having left only one Daughter, who was Marry'd to the Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi>'s Second Son.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> in General are very much Reſpected in <hi>Poland,</hi> but the Monks, or Regular Clergy, are more eſteemed than the reſt, and well entertain'd every where. They Read <hi>Homilies</hi> in the Churches, and carry the Sacrament privately to Sick Perſons, and even ſometimes Bury the Dead without asking the Conſent either of the Biſhop or Curat. The <hi>Mendicant Friars,</hi> who go about Begging Alms, enter boldly to the very Cloſets, without Knocking at the Door.</p>
               <p>The Monks in <hi>Poland</hi> are generally Rich; but they are neither Regular nor Modeſt, for they uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Drink in Cellars (which are the Taverns of that Country) and ſometimes to that Exceſs, that they are not able to walk in the Streets; without fearing either to be Cenſur'd by their Superiors, or to give any occaſion of Scandal to the People. The Faſts that are obſerv'd by the Monks, and by all the <hi>Polanders</hi> in General, conſiſt only in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from Milk, Eggs, and boiled Fiſh at Night, for they may eat dry'd Fiſh for their Collation; and provided they Faſt at that time, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they may Eat and Drink all the Day long: They Abſtain from Butter, Eggs and
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63304:106"/>Milk on Friday and Saturday; for they believe there is no difference betwixt Milk and Fleſh.</p>
               <p>As for the Secular Clergy, there are ſome of them who have not only Two Canonſhips, but Two Parſonages; but there are none of them who take care to perform the Duties of their Function. The Curates make the Monks Inſtruct their Pariſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and leave the other Duties of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be perform'd by Vicars. The Canons are never preſent at the Offices, and give a poor Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Two pence a day to ſay their <hi>hours</hi> for them in the Quire. And the Biſhops themſelves are ſo careleſs of their Epiſcopal Functions, that they dare not Correct the Inferior Clergy.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polanders</hi> ſeem very Devout, and beſtow conſiderable Gifts upon their Churches; but they are neither Liberal to the Poor, nor careful of their Sick Servants. They Pray aloud in the Church, and at the Elevation of the Sacrament at Maſs they Beat themſelves, and knock their Heads againſt the Pavement, or againſt the Bench on which they ſit, with ſo much Violence, that on ſuch occaſions there is always a great Noiſe in the Church. The Women commonly uſe their Prayer-Books, with a Chaplet of Beads drawn thro' the middle of 'em. In Winter all the Ladies of Quality, and even ſome Men, cauſe a Furr'd Bag to be brought to Church, in which they put their Feet, for the Weather is extreamly Cold, eſpecially for the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who have Fine thin Shooes; they wear alſo a little Furr'd Mantle upon their ſhoulders.</p>
               <p>The Churches of <hi>Poland</hi> are very Fine and well-adorn'd. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> of <hi>Leopold</hi> have a Chaſuble cover'd ſo thick with Pearls, and ſo heavy, that they cannot uſe it when they ſay Maſs; 'tis valu'd at above 100000 <hi>Livres.</hi> They Sing ſomewhat in the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Tongue every where, eſpecially in the Pariſhes at High-Maſs. The <hi>Roſary</hi> is alſo daily
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63304:107"/>repeated in the ſame Language in all the Churches of the <hi>Dominicans,</hi> where the Women are ſeated on one ſide, and the Men on the other; the Men alone Singing the <hi>Ave Maria,</hi> and the Women a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the <hi>Sancta Maria.</hi> There are Monks of all Orders in <hi>Poland,</hi> except <hi>Carthuſians</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimes.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. XXV. <hi>Of the</hi> Adminiſtration <hi>of</hi> Juſtice.</head>
               <p>THERE are two ſorts of Juriſdiction in <hi>Poland, Eccleſiaſtical</hi> and <hi>Civil.</hi> The former is in the hands of the Biſhops, who execute it by their Officials, from whoſe Judgment there lies an Appeal to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> the Primate of the Kingdom. And beſides the Authority of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Nuncio is ſo great, that he may Judge all Eccleſiaſtic Cauſes by Appeal.</p>
               <p>The Civil Juriſdiction is in the hands of ſeveral ſorts of Judges. The <hi>Staroſta's</hi> hold Courts within the Extents of their Territories, and each City has a Right to give Judgment in certain Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Every <hi>Palatin, Marſhal</hi> and <hi>Chancellor,</hi> has his reſpective Juriſdiction; The King, the Senate, and the General <hi>Diets</hi> determin Civil and Criminal Cauſes. And beſides, the Nobility have Three Courts, where they give Final Judgment in Cauſes without further Appeal. There are Two of thoſe Courts for the Kingdom, and one for the Dutchy. Thoſe of the Kingdom Sit at <hi>Peotrkow</hi> in Lower, and <hi>Lublin</hi> in Upper <hi>Poland;</hi> and that of the Dutchy is held one Year at <hi>Viina,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at <hi>Minsk,</hi> or at <hi>Nowogrodeck</hi> by turns. They are compos'd of a certain number of Gentlemen
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:63304:107"/>both of the Clergy and Laity, who are choſen in each <hi>Palatinat;</hi> the Lay-members once in Four Years, and the Eccleſiaſticks every Two Years. The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are given by Plurality of Voices; but, in Matters that are purely Eccleſiaſtical, the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Eccleſiaſtical Judges muſt be equal to that of the Secular. There are alſo Two Courts for Affairs relating to the <hi>Finances,</hi> one at <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> in Upper <hi>Poland,</hi> and the other at <hi>Vilna.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Palatins</hi> take Cognizance of nothing but ſuch Matters as relate to the <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Marſhals</hi> give Final Judgment, without further Appeal, in all Cauſes both Civil and Criminal, relating to the Officers of the King's Houſhold, and to the Domeſtick Servants of the Senators who remain with the King. The Juriſdiction of the <hi>Marſhals</hi> extends over the Merchants, and over all Forreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who are ſcarcely able to procure Juſtice in this Countrey.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Chancellors</hi> only determine ſuch Cauſes as are brought before them by Appeal, as the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Magiſtrates of Cities, and of <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins,</hi> when the Difference is between a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and a <hi>Jew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Puniſhments of Malefactors are of ſeveral kinds: ſome, for Example, are Hang'd, and others Beheaded. The variety of Puniſhments does not proceed from the different Qualities of the Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, but from the difference of the Crimes. For they Hang a Robber, of what Quality ſoever he be, and they Behead all ſorts of Perſons for all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Crimes but Robbery; unleſs for ſome Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Villanies, which are Puniſh'd, by Breaking the Malefactor on the Wheel, or by Cutting off two Thougs, or Long Pieces of the Skin of his Back.</p>
               <p>Maſters have alſo a power to Correct and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſe their Servants, which they do in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:63304:108"/>if the Servant that is to be Puniſh'd be a Gentleman, they make him lye down upon his Belly on a Carpet that is ſpread upon the Ground, then a Man Beats him on the Back with a Cord, or Stick, giving him as many Blows, or Laſhes, as the Maſter, who is uſually preſent, orders; after which, he who is Beaten, embraces the Knees of him who cauſed him to be Beaten, and calls him his <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</hi> This Correction ſeems a little too ſevere; but the Humour of the People makes it Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
               <p>Since I have mention'd the way of Puniſhing Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants who are Gentlemen, 'twill not be improper to obſerve, that <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen may ſerve as Coachmen, Grooms Cooks, and do all the meaneſt Offices, without derogating from their Nobility, or rendring 'em incapable of the Higheſt Preferment. For I have known ſome of them, who, after they had been Foot-boys to ſome Great Lord, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, who, after they had been Drummers to a Company of Dragoons, were advanc'd to the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Senators; And, in the General, there is nothing but a Handicraft-Trade that derogates from Nobility in this Countrey.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVI. <hi>Of</hi> Marriages <hi>and</hi> Funerals.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>MArriages</hi> and <hi>Funerals</hi> are extreamly Charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in <hi>Poland;</hi> For when a Gentleman Marries, whether he be Rich or Poor, the Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding muſt laſt three days. The Marriage of a Waiting-Gentlewoman puts her Lady to almoſt the ſame charge, as if one of her own Daughters were Marry'd. As for the Marriages at Court of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:63304:108"/>the Queen's Maids of Honour, or of the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſome Great Lords; on the firſt and ſecond day the King makes the Wedding-Feaſt, which is held in a Great Hall, where Three Tables are ſpread; the King and Queen ſit at the firſt, front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the reſt of the Hall; the Bride and Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom are Seated by the Queen's ſide, and the Pope's Nuncio and Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna</hi> ſit next the King: The Ambaſſadors are alſo ſeated at the ſame Table, oppoſite to the King and Queen; ſo that they are all under the Canopy of State. Yet there are ſome Examples to the contrary; For at the Feaſt which <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> III. made at <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi> upon occaſion of His Marriage with <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> in the Year 1606, he cauſed the Cardinal <hi>Maciejowski,</hi> the Pope's Nuncio, who was nominated to the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> to be remov'd from under the Canopy.</p>
               <p>The Ladies, Senators, and all the Officers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept thoſe who are to ſerve the King, are ſeated on both ſides of the other two Tables, which are very long: Before they ſit down, they are all call'd over, in order, that they may take their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces according to their Rank. The Feaſt begins uſually about Four or Five a Clock in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and they continue Drinking and Dancing till Two in the Morning. The Senators riſe from time to time from the Table, and go before the King to Drink His Health, and do Him Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience by bending the Knee.</p>
               <p>Tho the Tables are cover'd with all ſorts of Proviſions, yet they Eat but little at thoſe Feaſts, but they Drink abundance of <hi>Hungary</hi> Wine, which is very Excellent; and one may ſay, that tho 'tis very dear, 'tis more common, and leſs ſpared than Water; and there is not a Lady at Table who has not before her a Dozen of Glaſſes of Wine, of all the Healths that were Drank
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63304:109"/>round; For their Modeſty obliges 'em only to touch the Glaſs with their Lips; ſo that they ſpill more Wine upon the Tables, and in the Diſhes, than they Drink. After the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has laſted Five or Six hours, they begin to Dance to the Muſick of ſeveral Violins, and ſmall portable Organs. All ſorts of People Dance in <hi>Poland,</hi> both the Old, the Young, the Poor and the Rich. The Old Senators, and the Old Ladies begin the Dance, which they do ſo ſoftly and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly, that one would think it was a Company of Monks and Nuns walking in Proceſſion: But the Exerciſe grows warm by degrees, and ends, at laſt, with a Great Noiſe.</p>
               <p>On the Second Day every one Preſents the Bride with a Piece of Plate; all thoſe Preſents are made before the Queen, and the Bride who ſits by her. Thoſe who Preſent 'em make Harangues, which are oftentimes long and troubleſom; and the Queen's Chancellor Anſwers them all. So that this Ceremony, which commonly does not begin till Noon, laſts ſometimes till Three a Clock, after which, they begin to place themſelves at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>On the Third Day, the Ceremony of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is perform'd, all the Young People Accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying the Bridegroom and Bride to Church on Horſeback. In their return they paſs before the King's Pallace, the Trumpets and Kettle-drums continually Sounding from the Balconies on each ſide: After which, the ſame Train Conducts the King and the Queen, with the Bride, to the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom's Houſe, where there is a Magnificent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment prepar'd for them. After they riſe from the Table they Dance; and the Ball being over, every one retires; Then the Bride begins to Weep, for 'tis the Cuſtom of all the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewomen to ſhed Tears on that occaſion, and to
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63304:109"/>ſeem very much afflicted; becauſe, otherwiſe, they would run the hazard of being lookt upon as Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Shameleſs Women.</p>
               <p>Having given an Account of the <hi>Weddings,</hi> I proceed to ſpeak ſomething of the <hi>Funerals,</hi> which are ſo Pompous and Magnificent, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Triumph of a Living Man, rather than the Interment of the Dead.</p>
               <p>The Corps being put into a Coffin, is carry'd upon a Chariot, drawn by Six Horſes, cover'd with Black Houſings. The Coffin is Cover'd with a large Pall of Black Velvet, with a Croſs of Rod Sattin in the middle; Six of the Domeſtic Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the Deceas'd, in Mourning Habits, hold up the Corners of the Pall. The Chariot is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by Prieſts, Monks, and a great Multitude of People with Lighted Torches of White Wax. Three Men on Horſeback carry the Armour of the Deceas'd, one his Sword, the other his Lance, and the third his Dart. The Proceſſion Marches ſo ſoftly, that 'tis late before they come to the Church; where, after the Service is over, thoſe who carry'd the Arms of the Deceas'd, enter the Church on Horſeback, and, at a full Gallop, break the Arms againſt the Coffin, which is afterwards Interred. Then they return to the Houſe, where agreat Feaſt is prepar'd, and not only Drink to exceſs, but make the Eccleſiaſticks follow their Example.</p>
               <p>The Mourning Habits of the Men are not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from ours: but, on ſuch occaſions, the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Quality are Apparalled in courſe Black S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE <hi>Polanders</hi> ſeldom or never eat any Breakfaſts, but both the Men and Women, eſpecially the latter, uſually drink in the Morning Beer boyl'd with Ginger, Yolks of Eggs and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. They eat commonly, at their Meals, Beef and Veal, which are excellent in this Country. Their Mutton is not very good, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they uſually give it to their Servants. They have generally an averſion to cold Meat. They have abundance of Gray, but no Red Partridges, and great ſtore of Hares, but no Rabbets, which they do not look upon as an Inconveniency; for, generally ſpeaking, a <hi>Polander</hi> wou'd eat a Cat as ſoon as a Rabbet: yet they bring up ſome White Rabbets in their Chambers for the ſake of their Furs. There are abundance of Bucks, but few Stags in <hi>Poland;</hi> and many wild Boars, Hogs, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, Hens, Chickens, Turkey Fowl, Pigeons <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Ducks and Geeſe.

                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:63304:110"/>are certain Birds reſembling large Sparrows, which come into thoſe Provinces in the Winter: they are called <hi>Snow-birds,</hi> and are very agreeable to the taſte. The <hi>Polanders</hi> never eat any Tame-Fowl, but what is brought in the Morning alive into the Kitchin, where 'tis kill'd for Dinner. They are great lovers of ſucking-Pigs, which are very good Meat when they are Roaſted; but are commonly very ill Dreſs'd. The greateſt Lords ſeldom dine without a Diſh of Peaſe and Bacon; but the Bacon is cut into ſlices, and laid upon the Peaſe. They eat all ſorts of Muſhrooms that grow in the Woods, and even thoſe that grow upon Trees, which they gather, and dry, to preſerve 'em. Theſe Muſhrooms are reckon'd Poiſonous among us, but are as generally eaten in <hi>Poland</hi> as Poppy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, which they uſually devour like Millet.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Polanders</hi> never make Potage, but when they meet with any that is made by <hi>French</hi> Cooks they eat it with a great deal of pleaſure. Their Boil'd Meat is better, and more ſavoury than ours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they do not Boil it ſo much. Their Sauces are alſo extreamly different from thoſe that are in uſe among us: They make a Yellow Sauce, with Saffron, a White Sauce with Cream, a Grey Sauce with Onions, and a Black Sauce with the Juice of Plums. They ſeaſon all thoſe Sauces with a great quantity of Sugar, Pepper, Cinnamon, Ginger, Cloves, Nutmeg, Olives, Capers, and Prunes, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Sauce which they make for Fiſh, which they Dreſs better than the <hi>French.</hi> They uſe ſo much Spices, that there are ſome Lords who ſpend above 50000 <hi>Livres</hi> a Year in theſe Commodities.</p>
               <p>They uſually eat a great deal of Meat, and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bread, tho' there grows abundance of Corn in <hi>Poland,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Rye,</hi> which is much better than in <hi>France:</hi> They are alſo great lovers of Roots, which they dreſs well, and eat a great deal of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chat,</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:63304:111"/>which is a ſort of Meal made of Corn, as of Barley, Millet, or Oats, or ſometimes of a ſmall Grain which they call Manna. Theſe <hi>Cachats</hi> are very good when they are well Dreſs'd and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd: They eat them on Fleſh-days, with Milk and Butter, and on Faſting-days with Oyl, but ſome begin already to diſpenſe with this Rule, eſpecially on Saturdays.</p>
               <p>As there are few Fiſh in the <hi>Baltic,</hi> which is the only Sea that borders upon <hi>Poland,</hi> they are almoſt wholly deſtitute of Sea-fiſh; but that defect is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſupply'd by the great plenty of Freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water-Fiſh, ſuch as <hi>Pikes, Carps, Eels, Perches, Tenches, Breams, Trouts, Barbels, Shadds, Stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, Salmons, Lobſters,</hi> and <hi>Lampreys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The uſual Drink in <hi>Poland</hi> is Beer, but in <hi>Lithua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania</hi> they commonly drink Mead, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the numerous Swarms of Bees that are in the Forreſts of thoſe Countreys. After Meals the Gentlemen, and the Richer ſort of the Burghers, drink a Glaſs of <hi>Hungary</hi> Wine, becauſe they are of opinion, that Beer alone is too cold, and would injure their Stomachs, if not Corrected by the comfortable warmth of a Glaſs of Wine.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Lithuania</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krania</hi> they have two ſorts of Wines made of Honey, Red and White, or <hi>Mead</hi> and <hi>Metheglin;</hi> they are both pleaſant Liquors, tho' they taſte a little of the Wax. The Beer is very good, of an Amber-Colour, and of a brisk and poignant Sweetneſs, eſpecially that of <hi>Varka,</hi> or that which the Gentlemen make for their private uſe, which is commonly much ſtronger than that which the Brewers make to ſell.</p>
               <p>Beſides Beer and Mead, the <hi>Polanders</hi> and <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuanians</hi> drink alſo <hi>Hungary, Italian, French</hi> and <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wines. The firſt is better and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than any <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wine: 'Tis brought from
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63304:111"/>
                  <hi>Hungary</hi> to <hi>Cracow,</hi> over the <hi>Carpathian</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, in large Casks, drawn by Oxen, after which 'tis put in ſmaller Veſſels. The beſt ſort is ſold for 12 or 15 <hi>Livres</hi> the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Pot, which holds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 3 Quarts, and conſequently we may reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſuppoſe that the Poor are forc'd to abſtain from ſo Coſtly a Liquor.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Italian</hi> Wine is brought to <hi>Poland</hi> by Land; but is not ſo much us'd as the former, both by reaſon of the great diſtance, and becauſe of its Luſcious Sweetneſs, which makes it only fit for Women.</p>
               <p>The <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wines are brought by the <hi>Baltic-Sea</hi> to <hi>Dantzic.</hi> They are not only naturally weaker than <hi>Hungary</hi> Wine, but loſe a great deal of their ſtrength upon the Sea; for 'tis extreamly difficult to Tranſport the New Wines in <hi>November,</hi> by reaſon of the Ice which makes the Sea impaſſable. As for the <hi>Rheniſh</hi> Wine, it ſeldom goes farther than <hi>Dantzic,</hi> except a little which is ſpent in <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> and beſides they never drink it without Sugar, becauſe it is too ſharp.</p>
               <p>Tho the <hi>Poliſh Brandy,</hi> or <hi>Aquavitae</hi> is made of Corn, 'tis as good and ſtrong as that which is made of Wine; but 'tis almoſt only us'd by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, the reſt only drinking it when the Weather is exceſſively Cold.</p>
               <p>When the <hi>Polanders</hi> make a Feaſt, all the Gueſts who are Invited muſt bring a Knife, Fork and Spoon along with them, becauſe it is not a Cuſtom to lay any of theſe Utenſils upon the Table; they Sow a piece of Linnen round the Table-Cloath, which ſerves for Napkins. After all the Gueſts are come, the Gates are ſhut, and are not open'd till all the Company are riſen from the Table, and all the Plate is found; for if they did not uſe this Precaution, the Footmen would ſteal part of it;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63304:112"/>and this is alſo the reaſon why they lay neither Knives, Spoons, Forks, nor Napkins upon the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>Every Perſon of Quality has a Hall in his Houſe, which they call the Banquetting-Hall, in which there is a place for a Side-Table, ſurrounded with Balliſters. This Side-Table, from which the Cloath is never taken off till it be very dirty, is cover'd with abundance of Plate, and over it is a place for the Muſick, which is uſually Compos'd of Violins and Organs. Thoſe who are Invited to the Feaſt bring their Footmen with them, and as ſoon as they are ſeated at the Table, every one of them cuts off one half of his Bread, which he gives with a Plate full of Meat to his Servant, who, after he has ſhared it with his Comrade, ſtands behind his Maſter and eats it. If the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter calls twice for a Glaſs of Wine, or other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, the Servant brings as much more, and drinks in the ſame Glaſs with his Maſter without rinſing it. Tho' there is a great deal of Meat brought to the Table, there is nothing carry'd back to the Kitchen, not even of the laſt Courſe; for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſeize upon all the Meat, and their Ladies make each of them carry a Napkin to bring away the Dry Sweet-meats, or Fruits that are brought to the Table. After they have done Eating they uſually go to Dance.</p>
               <p>Theſe People, at leaſt the Genteeler ſort, eat very decently; for they never touch the Meat with their hands, and are ſo skilful in Carving, that they hold a Partridge upon the end of their Fork and cut it in Six pieces; But while they are at Table, they think of nothing but Eating; for the Gate is ſhut, and is never open'd till after Dinner or Supper.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XXVIII. <hi>Of the way of</hi> Travelling <hi>in</hi> Poland.</head>
               <p>THERE are no Inns in <hi>Poland,</hi> where one may Lodge conveniently, and be Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Bed. The only Houſes of Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are places built of Wood, which they call <hi>Karczma,</hi> where Travellers are oblig'd to Lodge, with the Horſes, Cows and Hogs, in a long Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble made of Boards, ill joyn'd, and Thatch'd with Straw; 'Tis true, there is a Chamber at the end of it, with a Stove, but 'tis impoſſible for one to Lodge in it in the Summer, becauſe of the Flyes, Fleas, Bugs, and the Noiſome Smell of the place, for they never open the Windows, even in the hotteſt Weather; ſo that Strangers chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lye in the Stables in the Summer, than in the Chamber. And beſides, the <hi>Goſpodarz,</hi> or Inn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper Lodges in that Room with his Children and whole Family, and uſually keeps a Hogſhead of
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:63304:113"/>ſtinking Cabbage, the ſmell of which is extreamly offenſive to Strangers, tho' the People of the Country, who are accuſtom'd to ſuch perfumes, are not incommoded by it.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who have occaſion to Travel in the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, may avoid part of theſe Inconveniencies by Lying in a Barn upon freſh Straw; for the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podarz</hi> gathers and Locks up every Morning the Straw which was given at Night to thoſe who Lodged in the Stable or Chamber, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it for thoſe who ſhaall come to Lodge af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them.</p>
               <p>When a Forreigner is oblig'd to Travel in <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> he ought to furniſh himſelf with a Calaſh drawn by Two Horſes, a Bed made of a Thin Quilt, a Small Feather-bed, a Pair of Sheets, a Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, a Coverlet, and an empty Straw-bed to wrap about the reſt of the Clothes. All this Baggage is put into a Sack or Bag of Serge, which ſerves for a Seat to him that Travels in the Calaſh. He muſt alſo provide a ſmall Caſe of ſix or eight Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles ſill'd with Beer, Wine, or Brandy, and a Basket for Bread, Boiled Meat and Candles, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out forgetting Oates for the Horſes, and Greaſe for the Wheels of the Calaſh. And beſides, he muſt remember to renew his Proviſions in every City, for there is little or nothing to be had in the Countrey Inns, and the Cities are very remote from one another.</p>
               <p>After one is thus fitted out, the Expence of his Journey is very inconſiderable, for his Lodging coſts him nothing, and I believe the Reaſon why the Inns are ſo poorly furniſh'd, is, becauſe the Gentlemen never pay for what they have. 'Tis no wonder then that the <hi>Goſpodarz</hi> deny them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing, and uſually Salute 'em with this Complement, <hi>Niemazſ,</hi> that is, <hi>There is none:</hi> nevertheleſs, they freely give what they have to
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63304:113"/>Strangers; But ſince there are few Travellers, the Inn-keepers make no Proviſion for them; So that they are oblig'd to go to the <hi>Dvour,</hi> or the Lord of the Village's Houſe for what they want.</p>
               <p>The whole Countrey of <hi>Poland</hi> is Plain, without Stones, or Hills, and conſequently very convenient for Travelling in a Calaſh with Two Horſes: There are ſeveral <hi>Polanders</hi> who have no Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and drive their own Calaſhes, ſo that they ſpend very little upon the Road, eſpecially in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; becauſe when they arrive at the <hi>Karczma,</hi> they put their Horſes to Graſs, and make the <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podarz</hi> give them a little Hay, which he is very unwilling to do, becauſe he is always afraid that he ſhall never be Paid. Others Travel on Horſeback, and carry along with them a Small Stiched Quilt to Lye upon, being about an Inch thick, and a Foot and a half broad, which they fold double, and lay it under the Saddle; and when they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at the Inn, they give the <hi>Goſpodarz</hi> Money to bring them ſome Brown Bread, Beer, and a little Oates; ſo that all the Charge for the Lodging of a <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentleman, and of his Horſe, does not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten amount to above 5 or 6 <hi>Gros,</hi> which are worth no more than Two pence. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that which is ſo Incommodious to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, is very Convenient for thoſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, becauſe they can Travel 100 Leagues on Horſeback, without ſpending above 50 Pence.</p>
               <p>As for the Lords and Ladies, they Travel al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in Coaches, and carry Waggons along with them, with Proviſions and Beds for themſelves and their Women; but their Attendants who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low 'em on Horſeback, are forc'd to content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſuch Lodgings as I deſcrib'd before. I muſt not forget to intimate, that a Traveller ought to be very careful in paſſing over the Bridges, becauſe they are generally bad, and the
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:63304:114"/>
                  <hi>Polanders</hi> take no care to keep them in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who Travel in Winter ought to provide a ſufficient quantity of Brandy, and a Furr'd Bag to put their Feet into. For 'tis ſo Cold in <hi>Poland,</hi> that thoſe who are in a Coach, Wagon, or Calaſh, cannot otherwiſe endure it: and ſince the Lakes and Rivers are ſo Frozen, that they eaſily Travel upon the Ice. They muſt take care, when the Earth is cover'd with Snow, to procure a Sledge, upon which they muſt place the Coach or Calaſh, and draw the Sledge with the Horſes.</p>
               <p>Travellers are very much incommoded in Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, eſpecially on Holy-dayes, for the Cold is ſo piercing, that 'tis impoſſible to be in a Chamber without a Stove in it: And beſides, on ſuch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn occaſions, all the Peaſants of the Village, who uſually drink nothing but Water, meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Carouſe with Beer and Brandy, and then Sing and Dance all Night, ſo that the weary Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller cannot ſo much as ſhut his eyes.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid enough to convince the Reader, that the manner of Travelling in <hi>Poland</hi> is extreamly Inconvenient to Strangers. As for the Native <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi> who Travel on Horſeback in the Winter, they have great Boots, into which they put Chaff, or chopp'd Straw, to keep their Feet warm, and before they Mount their Horſes they drink a large Draught of Brandy to preſerve 'em from the Cold. The Coachmen uſe the ſame precaution from the Cold, for otherwiſe they could never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Sharpneſs of the Weather, which is ſo exceſſively violent, that when a Man Travels with his Face expos'd to the Air, his Noſe ſometimes Freezes. Thoſe who have the Misfortune to meet with ſuch a Diſaſter, muſt apply Snow to the part, and carefully avoid entering into a Room where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is a Stove, or into any warm place, for
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63304:114"/>otherwiſe they would run the hazard of loſing their Noſe.</p>
               <p>There is no Travelling by Poſt in <hi>Poland,</hi> tho' there are Poſts for Carrying Letters and Pacquets. This Cuſtom was firſt eſtabliſh'd by Order of the Republick, in the Reign of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> IV. <hi>Anno</hi> 1647. For before that time the King's Orders were carry'd by Gentlemen of the Court, who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lig'd the <hi>Staroſta's</hi> to furniſh 'em with Horſes and Proviſions.</p>

               <p>THE Pieces of <hi>Gold</hi> which paſs Currently in <hi>Poland</hi> are <hi>Ducats,</hi> which are worth 2 <hi>French Crowns,</hi> or 2 <hi>German Rix Dollars,</hi> or 7 <hi>Livres</hi> of <hi>Dantzick</hi> Money, or 12 <hi>Livres</hi> of the Currant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of <hi>Poland,</hi> that is in <hi>Chelons.</hi> A <hi>Chelon</hi> is a piece of Copper, ſmaller than a <hi>French Denier;</hi> 3 <hi>Chelons</hi> make a <hi>Poliſh Gros,</hi> and 3 <hi>Groſs</hi> 2 Pence of the Countrey Money. So that to make up theſe 2 Pence, which are not worth above one of our Pennys, there muſt be 9 <hi>Chelons,</hi> which are not worth, and weigh no more than 2 <hi>Engliſh Farthings,</hi> whereby one may eaſily judge how much the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey is Ruin'd by ſo baſe a Coyn, which was firſt Introduc'd in a preſſing exigency, to ſatisfie the Army which had Confederated for want of their Pay.</p>
               <p>The Introducing of baſe Money into <hi>Poland</hi> is no new thing, as it appears by that which was Coyn'd by the Officers of <hi>Caſimir</hi> IV. and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63304:115"/>occaſion'd a Complaint to the <hi>Diet</hi> held at <hi>Peortrkow,</hi> in 1459. For at that time the Kings had the Privilege of Coyning the Money, and the firſt who yielded it up to the Republick was <hi>Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> III. in the Year 1632.</p>
               <p>There is another Baſe Coyn in <hi>Poland,</hi> call'd <hi>Tinfe,</hi> which was alſo brought into the Kingdom in the Year 1663, to pay the Confederated Army. The <hi>Tinfe</hi> which is a little larger than a <hi>French Fifteen pence,</hi> is of Silver, of a Baſe Allay. 'Tis worth 30 <hi>Gros</hi> of <hi>Chelons,</hi> which make 20 <hi>Pence</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> or 10 Common Pence.</p>
               <p>Beſides the <hi>Tinfes,</hi> there is another ſort of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney call'd <hi>Chouſtack,</hi> which is alſo a Piece of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Baſe Allay, and leſs than a <hi>French Sou:</hi> 'Tis worth 10 <hi>Gros</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſo that 3 of 'em make a <hi>Tinfe.</hi> Theſe Baſe Coyns do not paſs ſo currently at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> nor in any part of <hi>Pruſſia;</hi> for the <hi>Tinfes</hi> are not worth above 18 <hi>Gros,</hi> and the <hi>Chouſtacks</hi> Six <hi>Gros,</hi> of <hi>Dantzick</hi> Money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>Chelons</hi> of <hi>Dantzick</hi> are worth more than thoſe of <hi>Poland,</hi> which do not go at all there.</p>
               <p>The Money of <hi>Dantzick</hi> conſiſts in <hi>Ducats</hi> of <hi>Gold, Ourts, Chouſtaques,</hi> and <hi>Chelons;</hi> The <hi>Ducat,</hi> as I Intimated before, is worth 2 <hi>Rix Dollars,</hi> or 2 <hi>French Crowns.</hi> An <hi>Ourt</hi> is a Silver Coin of the bigneſs of a <hi>French</hi> Piece of <hi>Fifteen Pence,</hi> and is worth 18 <hi>Gros</hi> of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> or 30 <hi>Gros</hi> of <hi>Poliſh</hi> Money. A <hi>Chouſtaque</hi> is worth 6 <hi>Gros</hi> of <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick</hi> 10 <hi>Gros</hi> of <hi>Poliſh</hi> Money; and there muſt be 3 <hi>Chelons Dantzick</hi> to make a <hi>Gros:</hi> Yet 18 <hi>Gros</hi> of <hi>Dantzick Chelons</hi> make 30 <hi>Gros</hi> of <hi>Poliſh Chelons;</hi> Thus a <hi>Tinfe,</hi> which is worth 30 <hi>Gros</hi> of <hi>Poliſh Chelons,</hi> is worth but 18 <hi>Gros</hi> of <hi>Dantzick Chelons.</hi> The <hi>Ducat</hi> which is worth 12 <hi>Francks</hi> of <hi>Poliſh Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons,</hi> is worth but 7 <hi>Franks</hi> of Currant Money of <hi>Dantzick.</hi> Five <hi>Chouſtaques,</hi> or an <hi>Ourt</hi> and 2

At laſt, by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion of his Queen, that he might make way for the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> to Succeed him, he Abdicated the Government, and retir'd to <hi>France,</hi> where he was made Abbot of St. <hi>Germans.</hi>

            <head>SOME REMARKS UPON THE GOVERNMENT OF <hi>POLAND.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>'TIS Worthy Obſervation, as to the Election of a King in <hi>Poland,</hi> that whereas the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Gentry are the Keepers Preſervers and Defendors of the Liberty and Laws of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: Now for fear of a Change in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as has happen'd in <hi>France, Denmark, Swede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> where the Nobility, having been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and brib'd with Honours, and other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the Kings, have by degrees remitted from time to time ſome of their Rights and Immunities, ill at laſt they have fool'd themſelves out of their Freedom, into a Slaviſh Dependence on the Court; the Republick of <hi>Poland,</hi> warn'd by thoſe Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to avoid ſuch a Fate, has made a Law, That the Election of a King muſt be <hi>Nemine Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cente.</hi> An Inſtance of this may be given in the Election of King <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> the Fourth, a moſt
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63304:122"/>Warlike Prince, who was Choſen King of <hi>Poland</hi> (in conſideration of the great Services he had done the Common-wealth) with the unanimous Conſent of the Whole Nobility, excepting only one Deputy, who made a Solemn Proteſtation againſt the Votes of all the Diet; yet the ſaid Prince could not be Crown'd without the Conſent of the ſaid Deputy; Who being Ask'd why he thus Diſſented? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd; That he did it, that by this means the Privileges of the Nobility might be ſafe and lodg'd within his Power, tho all the reſt of the Nobility were corrupted. Having ſaid this, and cauſed his Proteſtation to be enter'd into the Records and Archives of the Kingdom, he preſently conſented with the reſt to the Election of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ladiſlaus</hi> the Fourth.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility being endow'd with ſo many Privileges, and the Deputies having always a free Vote, the Ariſtocratical State of <hi>Poland</hi> cannot well be chang'd by any of the Kings of <hi>Poland</hi> into an Abſolute Monarchy: For, whoſoever offers to do this, is declar'd by the Senate to be Perjur'd, and no more a King; which appears by the late King <hi>John</hi> the Third's Oath in <hi>Harnoc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides, the Nobility uſes immediately to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain in the open Senate, of the Tyranny of thoſe that attempt ſuch Innovations; as did a certain Deputy out of the Palatinate of <hi>Poſnania.</hi> King <hi>Stephen Bathori,</hi> after many Victories which he gain'd, and ſeveral Provinces with which he enlarg'd the Kingdom of <hi>Poland,</hi> began at laſt to endeavour to make himſelf Abſolute Monarch of <hi>Poland;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this Deputy expreſt himſelf in a Speech with ſo much Freedom, Boldneſs and Vehemence, that the King, Ambitious and Paſſionate in his Nature, not being able to let the Deputy run on any longer upon that Topic, interrupted him in theſe words, <hi>Hold your Tongue you Raſcal.</hi> To
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63304:122"/>which the Deputy made Anſwer, <hi>I am no Raſcal, but a Gentleman of</hi> Poland, <hi>an Elector of Kings, and a Depoſer of Tyrants.</hi> Whereupon the King ſaid to him, <hi>If I were not a King</hi>— And the Deputy Anſwer'd, <hi>If you were not</hi>— By which Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Reply the Deputy hinted to the King, that he did not want Courage to engage with him hand to hand for Liberty, if he had not been check'd by his Reſpect for the Majeſty of Kings.</p>
            <p>The King afterwards having buried all His Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, advanc'd him to the Higheſt Dignities; nor did he believe that this had any ways leſſen'd His Majeſty: on the contrary, he always eſteem'd him one of the Beſt Patriots and Lovers of his Country.</p>
            <p>If any of the Kings of <hi>Poland</hi> aim at Arbitrary Government, or Act contrary to the Religion and Laws of the Country, he is immediately Depos'd, or forc'd to Abdicate the Throne. The Form which King <hi>Caſimire</hi> us'd in His Abdication, is as follows.</p>

Whereupon we interpos'd the weighty Authority of the moſt Illuſtrious Senate, the humble Requeſts of the Knights of both Countries, the Intreaties of the whole Republick, and the Deſires of ſeveral Princes: Laſtly, We Objected to him the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions of the Laws, and the Ties of his Oath. But when all theſe Motives could not prevail, nor alter the unſhaken Mind of His Sacred Majeſty from His Thoughts of Eternity, we were at laſt forc'd to yield
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63304:124"/>to the Weight of our Fates, and no longer to attempt to remove His Majeſty from His-Reſolution. And forasmuch as His Sacred Majeſty has Iſſu'd forth His Letters Patent, which we had deſign'd for a Pledge of our Conſtant and Perpetual Fidelity; and has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded another more particular one, whereby he Releaſes us and all his Subjects from the Oath of Allegiance, and from all other Obligations: We likewiſe on our parts, by theſe our Letters Patent do Releaſe His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty from the Oath made by His Deputies, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Coronation in the Church of <hi>Warſaw,</hi> as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the Cathedral Church of <hi>Cracow:</hi> and we diſannul it to all intents and purpoſes, provided that our Rights and Priviledges in all things be preſerv'd, and that this Act may not prejudice a Free Election, our Laws and Liberties, nor be drawn into a Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. In Confirmation of the Premiſes we have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd our Hands. </p>

               <hi>AN ACCOUNT Of the</hi> Riſe of <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> in <hi>POLAND,</hi> And of the Preſent ſtate of that <hi>SECT.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>POLAND</hi> was at firſt Converted by S. <hi>Adal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> from Paganiſm to Chriſtianity; and has continu'd ſtedfaſt ever ſince for almoſt Seven hundred years in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> It was Inſtructed in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Principles by him, and has always paid a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great Reſpect to the Holy See, and endeavour'd to excel all others in their Zeal for its Intereſts. At preſent, ſince the Extirpation of the <hi>Huſſits, Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garians, Picards, Anabaptiſts, Arians, Tritheiſts, Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, Ebionites, Reactitorians,</hi> and a world of ſuch like Hereſies, and laſtly of the <hi>Socinians</hi> (who, by the Countenance of ſome Noblemen, and the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration once allow'd, had ſwarm'd in <hi>Poland</hi>) the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63304:125"/>
               <hi>Roman</hi> Religion chiefly prevails in that Country. The King indeed Promiſes upon Oath, before His Coronation, to Protect the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts.</hi> The <hi>Greeks</hi> likewiſe, and the <hi>Jews</hi> have the ſame Toleration there, which they have in many other Countries. And as the Caſe now ſtands, that Old <hi>Proverb,</hi> which ſays, <hi>Whoever has loſt his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may find it in</hi> Poland, falls to the Ground, and is no longer true of that Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as a Clear Account of the Preſent State of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> how they crept in, and how they were at laſt thrown out, cannot be met with in any other <hi>Author;</hi> I ſhall now give it ye as briefly, and orderly as I can.</p>
            <p>This Pernicious Hereſy of <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> which by <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ought to be deteſted above all others, which does not ſtrike at any particular Article, but ſhakes and almoſt overthrows the whole Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of our Religion, came out of <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
               <note place="margin">In the Year <hi>1546.</hi>
               </note> and began at firſt in the State of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice</hi> at <hi>Vincenza,</hi> by Forty Men. Two of them, <hi>Julius Treviſanus,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Ruigo,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, and Strangled at <hi>Venice,</hi> the reſt, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the ſame Fate, left <hi>Italy,</hi> and dwelt in <hi>Turkey, Poland, Tranſilvania, Suitzerland,</hi> and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where a Toleration of Religion was Allow'd.</p>
            <p>The firſt who ſpread the Errors of this Hereſy in <hi>Poland</hi> was a certain <hi>Dutchman</hi> nam'd <hi>Spicillus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias <hi>Fricius,</hi> a Diſciple of <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> and well skill'd in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> under the Reign of King <hi>Sigiſmund Auguſtus,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1546. He came to <hi>Cracow,</hi> where, according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Country, he was Treated very Nobly as a Stranger by the Mayor of the City. At this Treat there were ſeveral Noblemen, and among the reſt, <hi>Andreas Modrevius</hi> the King's Secretary. This Man, upon ſtarting ſeveral Doubts concerning the Ever Bleſſed Trinity, was the firſt that followed the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63304:126"/>
               <hi>Dutchman</hi> in his Errors; who, by the Secretary Means, induc'd the King Himſelf to be his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
            <p>The King being thus wrought upon by His Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary, the <hi>Dutchman</hi> was ſoon follow'd by <hi>Laelius Socinus,</hi> who being Baniſh'd out of <hi>Italy</hi> Abſconded at <hi>Zurich?</hi> where, when he once heard how ſucces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the <hi>Dutchman</hi> had ſpread his Hereſy in <hi>Poland,</hi> he immediately takes along with him <hi>Alicatus, Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> and <hi>Ochinus,</hi> three of his Aſſociates, and comes to <hi>Poland</hi> in the Year 1551. He was Introduc'd into the King's Court by the Secretary, where he Infus'd his Errors into <hi>Liſmaninus,</hi> Queen <hi>Bona</hi>'s Confeſſor, and many other Courtiers.</p>
            <p>Many Noblemen and Senators, of all Orders, were corrupted by theſe Men, and, at laſt, they drew in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Party <hi>James Sieninski</hi> Palatine of <hi>Podolia,</hi> and Lord of <hi>Racovia,</hi> one of the Chief Nobility. He turn'd from <hi>Calviniſm</hi> to <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> and Built a <hi>Printing-Houſe,</hi> and an <hi>Academy</hi> at <hi>Racovia</hi> for the Uſe of this Sect. This Town being very pleaſant for the Temperature of its Air, for the Sweetneſs of its Situation, for the Lakes, Fountains, Groves, Walks and Meads about it, quickly drew thither <hi>Fauſtus Socinus</hi> Couſin German to <hi>Lelius,</hi> with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others.</p>
            <p>Hereupon ſeveral Books were Publiſh'd, and ſpread over the whole Kingdom: and the Chief not only of <hi>Catholicks,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Lutherans</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts</hi> embracing the Opinion of <hi>Socinus,</hi> drew every day great Numbers to their Party. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Republick (for fear leaſt the Sparks al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready kindled ſhould ſet the Whole Nation in Flames, and leaſt the Plague, which had Infected many of the Members, ſhould, at length, deſtroy the Whole Body) by the Incitement of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and ſeveral other Religious Orders, oblig'd the King <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to Baniſh <hi>Liſmaninus</hi> the Queens
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63304:126"/>Confeſſor out of the Court, and induc'd him to iſſue forth the following Edict againſt the Growing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies in <hi>Poland.</hi>

And thinking this to be the proper Duty of Chriſtian Kings and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, do by theſe Our Letters Patent Teſtify and Promiſe, That We, out of Reſpect to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, and out of Love to the Holy Church, will Profeſs and Maintain, to the utmoſt of our Power, within all Our Dominions, the Truth and Sincerity of the Eccleſiaſtical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,

As for the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thereof, as well Pagans, who are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd Enemies of Chriſtianity, as Hereticks, who, under the pretence of being Chriſtians, and by a falſe Interpretation of Scripture, deſtroy Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and ſhew themſelves to be alienated from the Faith, and the Religion once deliver'd by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and hitherto Profeſs'd by the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholick Church: Theſe We ſhall take care to Suppreſs, and to Baniſh out of Our King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.

For the Due Performance of all the Premiſſes, We have Ingag'd Our Word to the Reverend Father in Chriſt <hi>Nicolas

In Teſtimony whereof we have Iſſu'd forth theſe Our Letters Patent, Dated at <hi>Cracow,</hi> In the Year of Our Lord 1550. And in the Second Year of Our Reign.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Edict or rather Manifeſto of King <hi>Auguſtus</hi> was interpreted by the Nobility to be directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to their Intereſts; Whereupon ſeveral of the Chief among them began to ſtir up Commotions, and riſe in Arms. And the Hatred of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticks againſt the <hi>Socinians</hi> increas'd every day more and more. Hence ſprung many Murders, conſtant Fewds between the Nobles, and abundance of Bloodſhed throughout the whole Kingdom. The State being engag'd in a foreign War could not then prevent theſe great diſorders: but partly fearing a Civil War, and partly truſting to the Vigilance and Paſtoral Care of the Eccleſiaſticks for the preſent forbear'd putting in Execution the ſevere Laws of <hi>Jagello</hi> againſt Hereticks. But at laſt they work'd their own Ruin. For being by degrees divided into the Factions of <hi>Servetus</hi> and <hi>Samoſatanus,</hi> they too far treſpaſs'd on that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence the State allow'd them. Several Statues of our Saviour upon the Croſs were broken by the Students of <hi>Racovia,</hi> and ſeveral Blaſphemies were utter'd in their Books againſt Chriſt; and for theſe things being ſeverely check'd by the Decrees and Edicts of <hi>John Caſimire,</hi> and King <hi>John</hi> III. all thoſe who would not Embrace the <hi>Roman</hi> Faith were to depart the Kingdom within two or three Years. Since thoſe Decrees of the King and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick againſt the <hi>Socinians</hi> are ſtill in force, it will
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:63304:128"/>not be amiſs to inſert them here, and they are as follow.</p>

               <p>YOu deſire that I ſhould give you an Account of our preſent Calamity and Diſtreſs, Alaſs! you command me to renew an unſpeakable Woe, to run over again the Remembrance of our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and to make our Wounds, raw and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping as they are, to Bleed afreſh. My Soul ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers at the reflexion of thoſe many Fatal Blows we have receiv'd. Not only my Mind, but my Hand and Pen ſhake at, and fly back from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63304:129"/>of thoſe Misfortunes which have hitherto purſu'd us, and whereof I my ſelf was an Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs. We were, ah we were a happy Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and now the very remembrance of that Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, which our Churches, for ſo many years, by the Divine Favour did enjoy, does ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſenſe of our preſent Troubles the more ſevere. So that we are loth ſo much as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, when, how, and by what ſteps we fell from being what we were. And did not the goodneſs of the Cauſe for which we ſuffer, and the Conſolations of this kind of Patience ſupport our Minds, it would be better for us, who are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt overwhelm'd with ſuch a vaſt weight of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, to forget all that is paſt, that ſo our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Miſeries might be born the more eaſie. Yet becauſe you are deſirous of having ſome deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of our preſent Condition, we will give it you, not drawn in its own proper and lively Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, but ſet off in the plaineſt Dreſs, and ſuch things as are but a trouble for us to inſiſt long upon, theſe we ſhall but lightly touch. Nor do I think it worth the while to give you, in a long train, a Catalogue of unknown Names, if the Faithfulneſs of the Relators be ſuſpected, upon the account of the Inraged, or at leaſt ignorant Witneſſes and Judges of our Cauſe. 'Tis a great Enhancement to the Misfortunes of the Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But tho' fortune has abandon'd us in our Miſery, yet we ſtill retain our Integrity. It is beſt therefore to ſhew you the Beginnings of our Troubles, and when theſe are once known, it will be viſible to every one, how abſurd and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt it is to diſcredit the Truth of thoſe things, which by the very Nature of our Sufferings can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be otherwiſe. The firſt Riſe of our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles we may date from the War begun in our Country with the <hi>Coſſacks,</hi> in the Year 1648,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63304:130"/>whereby ſeveral Inhabitants of the Country, and many of our Countrymen, eſpecially thoſe of us, who were borderers on the <hi>Boriſthenes,</hi> were ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled of our Eſtates and Poſſeſſions, or at leaſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd irreparable Loſſes. Upon this, long before the Law of <hi>Proſcripion,</hi> made in the Year 1668, I, with the greateſt part of my Eſtate was ruin'd; and for the full ſpace of Ten years before the Baniſhment was an Exile; and, with ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our Friends, were, as it were, caſt away before the Storm came. Immediately after this the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and within a while the <hi>Swedes,</hi> and at laſt the <hi>Tranſilvanians,</hi> made Incurſions in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our Country, which put the whole Kingdom into great Confuſion, and not the leaſt Creature in it was free from theſe Outrages. For their own Soldiers were ſo inſolent, and the Auxiliary Troops of <hi>Scythia</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> ſo violent, that they could neither eſcape by flight, nor repel by Armes their unjuſt Force. We were not indeed the only Perſons who ſuffer'd by the Wars; but we alone were thoſe, who, exhauſted by ſo many Wars, and almoſt Expiring, were harraſs'd by a Peace more cruel than any War, at a time when others were at quiet: and by our Conſtant ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with an adverſe Fortune, it ſeems as if the former Wars had inſpir'd a Spirit of Perſecution into the Peace which follow'd. Altho' in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heat of the Wars our Enemies were ſo indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, as to find out means whereby the heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Weight of the War might fall on our heads. For upon the Abdication of King <hi>Caſimire,</hi> while the <hi>Swedes</hi> were Maſters of <hi>Cracow,</hi> the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, from all Provinces of the Kingdom, flock'd thither to adjuſt Matters with the Enemy, and their Armies, with their Generals, ſeparated, and almoſt all Orders bought their Peace by Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring. But that we might not ſhare the benefit
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:63304:131"/>of that ſhort Peace, our Inveterate Enemies fell upon us and Plunder'd us, whilſt we dream'd of no ſuch danger, and were every one of us quiet in our own Habitations. This ſudden Evil was the Death of ſome of our Party, and of ſome of my own Relations; but ſeveral, who, with much ado, eſcap'd from theſe Pillagers, fled to <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi> which was then Govern'd by a <hi>Swediſh</hi> Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon. Tho they were forc'd upon this Flight, through Fear, and had long before this volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thrown themſelves under the Protection of the <hi>Swedes:</hi> yet this was afterwards moſt unjuſtly laid to their Charge as a Crime; and no Courſe of Law was us'd in the Oppreſſing of our Friends. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Maſs-Prieſts, who were Arm'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſurrounded with Armed Troops, ſet upon the Houſes of Noble-Men, which they Plunder'd and Fir'd; and abus'd the Noble Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons by Rapes, and all manner of Barbarities. The Supreme Court of Judicature, even before the Law Enacted againſt us, exercis'd the utmoſt ſeverity thereof againſt us in many ſad Inſtances: and, among the reſt, my Son-in-Law, the Patron of the Church of <hi>Siedlicia,</hi> ſuffer'd juſt before that Law was made. At laſt, after ſo many unlawful Proſecutions of Innocent Perſons, came out that Law, an upſtart Patroneſs of all thoſe Injuries we ſuffer'd, and by an unheard-of Example, enter'd, as it were, through the very Jaws of our Liberty into the Body of our Laws. At firſt, indeed, it ſeem'd ſuperfluous, ſince without a New Law, and contrary to the Ancient Conſtitutions of the Government, we were obnoxious, not only to the Injuſtice of Publick Magiſtrates and Judges, but alſo to the Luſt and Violence of Private Men. But yet we ſoon found it Arm'd with New Inſtruments of Miſchief, and ſuch as not only gave a ſpecious pretence to all the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63304:132"/>unjuſt proceedings both of Judges and private perſons, but alſo ſuch as expos'd us Friendleſs and Helpleſs, and as it were bound hand and foot to the rage and <hi>Odium</hi> of our Enemies. We have not time at preſent to enquire how unlawfully it was enacted, and how full of Abſurdities it was. 'Tis enough to ſhew how fraudulent and Cruel it was, even whilſt it pretended to Mercy and Clemency. For we were by the Law conſtrain'd to depart the Kingdom within three years, which time was allow'd, under a pretence of ſelling off our Effects. But the Benefit even of this unjuſt Law deceiv'd many one, that falſe favour was ſoon recall'd, the time being contracted to the ſpace of only one Year; ſo that almoſt all of us had not leaſure of diſpoſing of our Affairs as We ought. Thereupon very few could ſell off their Effects, and the greateſt part of thoſe who did, were forc'd to part with very rich Eſtates to the Purchaſers at a very low and almoſt no price. For the Injuſtice of the Purchaſers was ſuch, as to take advantage not only of the urgent Neceſſity and danger of the Sellers, but likewiſe of the great want of Money, and of the Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they labour'd under, being reduc'd to great Straits by the Loſſes and Devaſtations of ſo many Wars.</p>
               <p>I will give ye inſtances of this Nature. A Noble Matron the Patroneſs of the Church of <hi>Pebrinen,</hi> could ſcarce fell her Dowry worth ſeveral Thouſand <hi>Dollars</hi> for Three hundred Florins. <hi>Chriſtopher Oſirovius</hi> a very Worthy Knight ſold his Eſtate worth Ten thouſand <hi>Dollars,</hi> for Three thouſand Florins, that is for the tenth part of its due Value. And he truly happen'd on a very modeſt Chapman; for others were forc'd to be contented with the fifteenth, Others with the Twentieth part, and many receiv'd
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:63304:132"/>nothing but a bare promiſe of Payment. This oblig'd ſeveral of us rather to make over our Effects to our friends by way of truſt. But at laſt the Houskeepers with a miſerable train of Children and Kindred were conſtrain'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part their Native Country. Some went to <hi>Sileſia,</hi> but the greater number towards <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilvania;</hi> but neither of them were free from the Inſults of Robbers. They who went to <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> before they had arriv'd at their Journey's End, were Plunder'd of their Proviſions and Effects by the <hi>Imperialiſt</hi> Soldiers, who had, as they ſay, private Intimations of their March given them by the <hi>Polanders.</hi> This Miſchance together with the Storm of War which was hanging over that Country, brought ſeveral, who were return'd to <hi>Poland,</hi> into our Country of <hi>Pruſſia:</hi> But the reſt with a mind prepar'd for danger enter'd into <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> poor and in tatters: where, as the Reward of ſo many Fatigues, Troubles and hazards, the Plague and Poverty gave them entertainment. Is it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be wonder'd that ſeveral in our Churches were torn from the Faith and the Love of Truth through the dread of ſo many Miſeries and Dangers? Or rather is it not more to be wonder'd that any ſhould continue conſtant in their Profeſſion? For our Preſent Perſecution did not proceed after an uſual and ordinary way: But to extinguiſh that Light of Truth which ſhone upon us, <hi>Satan</hi> endeavour'd all he could to ſhake our Conſtancy not ſo much by the fear of Death, which is ſoon over, as by the Torment and Puniſhment of a Life ſtretch'd out to its full length in Miſeries. Nor did the Thunder of the dreadful Decree you make mention of, whereby we were baniſh'd our Country, ſo much terrify us, as did that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="244" facs="tcp:63304:133"/>which within a while after was added to that moſt Cruel Law by new Edicts of the Diet, and which was afterwards exercis'd in many cruel Inſtances. By this we were depriv'd of all the Service and Aſſiſtance of our Friends, and of all Hopes of Succour from our Country, whilſt thoſe who ſuccour'd us, or adminiſtred to our Wants, if they were thereof found Guilty, were us'd more ſeverely than we our ſelves were. For when any one of us were apprehended or return'd, if he would be reconcil'd to the Romiſh Communion, he was immediately Reſtor'd to his Rights and Eſtate without any more trouble: But if a <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Lutheran</hi> ſhould be found guilty of holding the Leaſt Commerce and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with us, his Eſtate was unavoidably confiſcated, without the leaſt hopes of Remedy. Thus was the only Refuge which we had left taken from us, and all thoſe with whom we had intruſted any thing were forc'd to be treacherous even againſt their Wills; Nor dar'd any one to ſupply our wants for fear of being puniſh'd.</p>
               <p>Having thus laid before you the Misfortunes which we undergo, what Man can any longer make a queſtion of it? Suppoſe every one of theſe Exiles when they left their Native Soil, were enrich'd with New Treaſures for a Subſiſtance; yet what by the Expences of ſo many Journeys, and what by the Loſſes they ſuſtain'd, theſe might be well conſum'd by this time. But if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider things well, we ſhall find that many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted their Country Naked as Men that had eſcap'd a Wreck: that the reſt by Robberies and the Expences of ſo many years loſt all they had laid up to ſerve their Neceſſary Occaſions. And now there was no ſafe Retreat remaining for thoſe miſerable Exiles, but Troubles and Dangers follow them whereever they go,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63304:133"/>and force them to wander like Vagabonds from place to place. At preſent a freſh Storm from <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and a freſher from <hi>Sileſia</hi> threatens us, ſince 'tis reported that our friends are to be baniſh'd both theſe places, which God forbid or at leaſt turn to our Good. And now I begin to fear that the World looks upon our Troubles as of no moment, or at leaſt thinks them ſo light as we can eaſily bear them; eſpecially ſince none can imagine that there are no leſs than a Thouſand Families which ſtand in need of your Aſſiſtance. But this account would not ſeem too high, if all, againſt whom the ſeverity of this Law is directed, would ſuffer for the Cauſe of Chriſt and Truth. But alas! A great many Houſekeepers (more than we could Wiſh) that they may not be oblig'd to others for ſupplies, provide for their own Safety by being already ſhaken from their Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs, and by abſconding in their own Country; Whereas there are but few, who are ſo bold as to take upon them the Yoke of Chriſt openly. Nor do thoſe who are within the City of <hi>Cruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> and the neighbourhood of it dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, leaſt they ſhould be found out by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of <hi>Breſlaw</hi> a Warm <hi>Calviniſt.</hi> Many are diſpers'd in ſafer Places of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania,</hi> namely in the Upper <hi>Sileſia, Marchia, Pruſſia, Tranſilvania:</hi> and ſome in <hi>Holſtein</hi> and the Palatinate in <hi>A anbeim.</hi> We all hold a mutual Correſpondance together notwithſtanding the Diſtance of our Habitations, as far as it is allow'd us, and where we can, we adminiſter to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Neceſſities. As for the Money lately ſent, it was faithfully and impartially diſtributed to all who were in Want throughout <hi>Sileſia, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, Pruſſia, Poland, Tranſilvania,</hi> and <hi>Holſtein,</hi> and reach'd even our Brethren at <hi>Rotterdam</hi> and other diſtant Countries. In behalf of them we
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:63304:134"/>touch'd with a due ſenſe of that favour return, our moſt unfeigned thanks, praying the Great God of Heaven the giver of all goodneſs, to powr down on your Liberal Souls the full ſtreams of his Bounty; and that he who has promis'd that <hi>a Cup of Cold Water ſhall not go unrewarded,</hi> would repay you this Extraordinary Refreſhment of your afflicted Brethren in full meaſure, preſs'd down, and running over. Oh how ſweet a Smell does ſuch a holy Sacrifice ſend up to God! How highly commendable is it in the ſight of him who looks down from above, how deeply does it reproach the Delays and Niggardlineſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He loves the Chearful Givers: He deſires nothing from the Unwilling, nothing from the ſad and diſcontented Soul. He eyes the Mind of the Giver not the Gift. Nor would we be thought to be over importunate in deſiring a neceſſary Relief. If they can ſpare a little out of their Abundance, who among us would deſire to defraud the Poor of it, ſince we our ſelves are likewiſe poor and would not be ſo cruel to thoſe in Want, but we are ready to impart to them even that little which we have? But if any of you have enough and to ſpare, let him conſider his own Condition as in the Preſence of God. We Require nothing of any one beyond his Abilities, and we require not ſo much as what is Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, if it ſeem; a burden. There is a God who takes care of our Wants and Neceſſities, and Laughs at their Prepoſterous Sollicitude, who fear, leaſt that which they can give would not be enough to Supply our Neceſſities: as if our Induſtry and God by his aſſiſtance could not make up the Deficiency. I have but two things more to add, the firſt is to inform you, that it was not any ſault of the Diſtributers that the Wants of all were not reliev'd, eſpecially in our
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:63304:134"/>
                  <hi>Pruſſia.</hi> For many of them dayly flock hither, not only out of <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Lithuania;</hi> but alſo ſome of thoſe who through fear or neceſſity had revolted to the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> were faln of from them again. Of whoſe place of habitation we had not a certain Information, ſo that hence aroſe the Difficulty of not giving an exact Number of the Exiles. The ſecond thing is to tell you, that I have a great have many things to communicate to you, beſides thoſe which the Reverend <hi>Spinocius</hi> brought. In the mean time my Commentaries on our Saviours firſt Sermon I intend to dedicate to you, and will ſend it the firſt Oportunity. But I earneſtly deſire that nothing may be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd under my true Name whilſt I am alive and without my Knowledge. If any ſuch ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the World, 'tis beſt that <hi>Julius Celſus</hi> ſhould bear the <hi>Odium</hi> of thoſe things which may be offenſive. Farewel beſt of Friends, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to pray to God for me.</p>

            <head>A SHORT ACCOUNT Of the Late INTERREGNUM IN POLAND, AND THE <hi>ELECTION</hi> OF THE Preſent KING.</head>
            <p>HAVING given the <hi>Reader</hi> (<hi>Page</hi> 221.) a ſhort Epitome of the Moſt Glorious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>John Sobieski,</hi> late King of <hi>Poland;</hi> it will not be amiſs to Compleat his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to take notice here of his Conduct, during the latter end of his Life, which has ſo little an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the Glorious beginning of his Reign.</p>
            <p>That Prince entered into a Common League with the Emperour, the Republick of <hi>Venice,</hi> and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63304:137"/>the <hi>Pope,</hi> againſt the Common Enemy of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> And notwithſtanding the Emperour and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians</hi> carry'd on the War with ſo much Vigour and Succeſs, as to give a fair Opportunity to the <hi>Poles</hi> to regain <hi>Caminiek,</hi> and the Provinces the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> have got from them; yet, to the great Amazement of the World, the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Army did nothing at all, and was not able to Protect their Country againſt the Excurſions of their Enemies, who committed unſpeakable Diſorders, and carryed a Great Multitude of People into Slavery. This occaſion'd Great Murmurs amongſt the <hi>Poles</hi> againſt their King and was ſuch a Blot as traniſh'd the Luſtre of his former Actions. Several have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into the Cauſes of ſo odd a Conduct; for, that Prince wanting neither Courage or Ability, every body thought that the Miſcarriage of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of <hi>Poland</hi> was owing to the King Himſelf.</p>
            <p>There have been many Conjectures on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but the onely who appears to me, well ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is that Princes Covetouſneſs; and, after an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial examination, this ſeems to me the only <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mora,</hi> who ſtopp'd the Vigorous Reſolutions that were Yearly taken. Old Men, generally ſpeaking, are Covetous, the reaſon whereof is plain enough; but, beſides this, almoſt natural Byaſs, the little Eſteem the <hi>Poles</hi> had for Prince <hi>James,</hi> was a great Motive to ingage his Father to heap up Money, tho' to the viſible Detriment of the Republick. That Prince ſeeing, as I have ſaid, that the <hi>Poles</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed little eſteem for his Eldeſt Son, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly having no proſpect that he ſhould Succeed him, meerly upon account of his being Born of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Family; and on the other hand, knowing by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that Money is the beſt Argument to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend a Prince to the Choice of the <hi>Poles,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to Hoard up Money, and therefore left His Army unpaid, the Magazines unprovided, and lived
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:63304:137"/>very Parſimonious in his Houſe. The ſame reaſon obliged him to ſet a Tax upon ſeveral things that were formerly given <hi>Gratis</hi> at his Court, as <hi>Paſſes, Petitions,</hi> and the like. <hi>France,</hi> on the other hand, being ſenſible, that the <hi>Turks</hi> could hardly make head againſt ſo many Enemies, if all of them carry'd on the War with Vigour, made a good uſe of the Covetouſneſs of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and by means of a Yearly Penſion to that hungry Prince, diſappointed all the Deſigns of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility, who could hardly bear, without Murmur, that <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick</hi> ſhould continue ſo long in the hands of the Infidels.</p>
            <p>A Violent and very Extraordinary Diſtemper King <hi>John</hi> laboured under, giving him a ſufficient Warning of his Death drawing nigh, he tryed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ways to have his Son Choſen his Succeſſor in his Life-time, but all in vain; for that being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Laws and Conſtitution of <hi>Poland,</hi> it has been rarely practiſed, and the King was not beloved enough to oblige the <hi>Poles</hi> to Act againſt their own Laws. Thus ſtood the Affairs of <hi>Poland,</hi> when King <hi>John</hi> Dy'd, which happen'd the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> at Nine a Clock at Night, 1696. The News of the King's Death was immediately carryed, by an Expreſs, to Dardinal <hi>Radziowsky,</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Gneſna,</hi> Primate of the Kingdom, and <hi>Regent</hi> during the <hi>Interregnum;</hi> who made his Entry into <hi>Warſaw</hi> on the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> that is, Seven days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the King's Death, in a moſt Solemn and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent Manner. All the Senators and Nobility then in Town Rode forth above a League from the City to meet him, with Colours flying, and Kettle Drums beating in the midſt of an incredible Crowd of People. His Eminence went directly to the Caſtle, and aſcended into the Room where the King's Body lay expoſed in His Royal Robes; and having ſaid a ſhort Prayer, went to the Queens A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63304:138"/>to Condole her Majeſty. He did the like to Prince <hi>James</hi> and his Brothers, and took upon him the Government of the Kingdom, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a General Dyet to Meet on the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> following, to Chooſe a Succeſſor.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Cardinal Primate</hi> has made a great noiſe ſince that time, it will not be improper to give his Caracter in this place. He is of a very good family in <hi>Poland,</hi> and Son to the famous <hi>Radziousky</hi> who called in the <hi>Swedes</hi> under <hi>Charles Guſtavus.</hi> He is a Man of great Parts, but ſomewhat obſtinate. <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> XI. made him a Cardinal without any other recommendation but his own merit: the then King of <hi>Poland</hi> tho' his Relation nor the French King were pleaſed with his promotion, tho' time has diſcover'd that his Eminence is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely in the Intereſts of France. He went to <hi>Rome</hi> after the doath of <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. and was preſent at the chuſing of a new <hi>Pope</hi> which, fell on <hi>Cardinal Ottoboni.</hi> He lived like a Prince, and his magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence and Liberality acquired him a great many Friends.</p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> the <hi>Dyet</hi> aſſembled with the uſual Ceremony, and after the <hi>Maſs</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> had been celebrated by the <hi>Cardinal Primate,</hi> they began to talk of the Election of a <hi>Mareſchal</hi> or <hi>Speaker</hi> of their Aſſembly, which gave occaſion to many diſputes. The Leſſer <hi>Poland</hi> pretended that it was her turn to have a <hi>Mareſhal</hi> choſen out of her Body, and Greater <hi>Poland</hi> put in the ſame claim, but was inclinable to wave it. The <hi>Lithuanians</hi> oppoſed it pretending that the Greater <hi>Poland</hi> was to take their turn now, that <hi>Lithuania</hi> might have theirs in the next <hi>Dyet,</hi> and their diſpute grew ſo high that People were affraid the <hi>Dyet</hi> would break up without coming to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. The Biſhop of <hi>Poſen</hi> thought of a new way to put an end to the controverſy, and came
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63304:138"/>to the Aſſembly in proceſſion at the head of his Clergy pretending to allay their heats by the <hi>Charms</hi> of his <hi>Benedictions,</hi> but this provoked the Deputies who told him, in great ſcorn, they were not poſſeſt, and therefore had no need of his Exorciſms. At laſt the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> conſented that the Leſſer <hi>Poland</hi> ſhould appoint the <hi>Mareſchal,</hi> and the choice fell upon Monſieur <hi>Omienisky</hi> Lieutenant Collonel of the Artillery.</p>
            <p>The next day this Diſpute was over, news came that the Army had Confederated themſelves for their own Intereſts; for the King, as I have already obſerv'd, having not taken care to pay the Forces, a vaſt Sum was due to them for their Arrears. They choſe an Officer, called, <hi>Baronowsky</hi> for their General, and promiſed to remain united till they had receiv'd Satisfaction. In the mean time they reſolved to raiſe contributions for their Subſiſtance.</p>
            <p>This news put the <hi>Dyet</hi> in great Conſternation, and likely contributed to the reſolutions they took the ſame day, which was to lay aſide all Objections againſt the Validity of the Election of the Deputies with this proviſo, that none ſhould have a voice in the <hi>Dyet</hi> till they had freely ſatisfied the Aſſembly about the reaſons that ſhould be offer'd againſt them. They repaired afterwards in great Ceremony unto the Senators Hall, and the Marſhal made a ſpeech to the <hi>Cardinal Primate,</hi> ſetting forth the deplorable condition of the Kingdom ſince the Kings death, returned thanks to his Eminency for his great care of the Publick, and declared that the Deputies were ready to concur to the utmoſt of their Power to all the Propoſals that ſhould be made for the Good of the Nation. The <hi>Primate</hi> returned an anſwer ſuitable to the circumſtances of the time, and propoſed ſeveral Points to be taken into conſideration by the Aſſembly. 1. An Aſſociation of all the Members
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63304:139"/>of the Kingdom for the Security of it. 2. To draw up Laws and Conditions to which the future King ſhould be obliged and to publiſh them that all Pretenders to the Crown might be informed thereof. 3. To find and apply a proper remedy to the Factions, Quarrels and Animoſities, which had been ſo prevalent under the preceeding Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and prevent the like for the future. 4. To provide for the ſpeedy Payment of the Army, as the only way to prevent Mutinies and Seditions amongſt the Souldiers, and for carrying a vigorous War againſt the <hi>Turks.</hi> 5. To repair the defects of the <hi>Artillery,</hi> which was in a very bad condition. 6. To ſettle a ſort of Money that might be current all over the Kingdom to prevent the Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies proceeding from the diverſity of Coyns. 7. and laſtly, That the Election of a new King might be deferred for ſome time.</p>
            <p>Nothing material was tranſacted ſince that day to the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> that there happned a violent diſpute in the Aſſembly, whether the Queen ſhould not be deſired to remove out of <hi>Warſaw,</hi> for tho' the greateſt part of the Provincial <hi>Dyets</hi> had reſolved not to ſuffer the Royal Family to reſide in the Place where the General <hi>Dyet</hi> was to Aſſemble, and that Prince <hi>James</hi> in compliance with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution had already left that City, yet the Queen would not conform herſelf to their deſires, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the advices of the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Poſnania,</hi> and the Palatine of <hi>Plosko,</hi> which put the <hi>Dyet</hi> in a great heat, ſome taking that pretence to leave the Aſſembly. At laſt her Majeſty was perſwaded to yeild unto their deſires, and left actually <hi>Warſaw</hi> on the <hi>18th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> and went for <hi>Dantzick.</hi> This calm'd ſomewhat the <hi>Dyet,</hi> but a diſpute between the <hi>Cardinal Primate</hi> and the <hi>Marcſehal</hi> of the Deputies was like to break up the <hi>Dyet;</hi> however it was agreed to
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:63304:139"/>enter into an Aſſociation, which was drawn up by a Domeſtick of the Cardinal Primate, and read by him to the States. No body made any Objection to the firſt Articles; but when he came to mention the Liberties and Priviledges of the Clergy, the Grand Marſhal of <hi>Lithuania</hi> bid him ſtop, and laid before the Aſſembly, in a very Pathetick Speech, the Injury and Affronts he had received from the Biſhop of <hi>Vilna,</hi> deſiring the Cardinal Regent that he might have Satisfaction given him. The Grand Marſhal of the Crown made likewiſe great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Culm,</hi> for having Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd Libels againſt him to blemiſh his Reputation. The Cardinal Anſwer'd them, That as the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual State could not Judge the Temporal, neither could the Secular give Laws to the Eccleſiaſtick; and that it was to be left to the Pope to Puniſh the Proceedings of the Biſhops, which was Agreed to on both ſides.</p>
            <p>This Point being thus over, the Act of Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was Read on; but when they came to the Point of Reconciliation, between thoſe, who being Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, yet do not Agree in ſome Matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; one of the Deputies made ſome Exceptions, and it was agreed, That all things ſhould remain, as to that Point, as they had done, during the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terregnums</hi> of <hi>Caſimir</hi> and <hi>Michael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Diſputes about Fixing the time of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a New King was more conſiderable; many of the Deputies inſiſting, That the Deplorable Condition of the Republick required a Speedy Choice; but the other Party being Swayed by a Private Intereſt, was Stronger; and, upon a Fair Pretence, the Election was deferr'd to the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1697, and it was agreed that it ſhould be done in the Open Field, by all the Nobility Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd together, as at the Election of <hi>Michael Wiez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowisky;</hi> and that whoever ſhould Propoſe a Native
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63304:140"/>of the Kingdom, ſhould be look'd upon as an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of his Country.</p>
            <p>This being Concluded, and the Act of Aſſociati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on drawn up, the Deputies met again upon the Firſt of <hi>October,</hi> and ſome of them demanded, that the ſaid Act might be Read again; but this was Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Cardinal Primate; ſaying, That a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reading would only create New Cavils, and ſo Sign'd it immediately, with moſt of the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the reſt did the like afterwards. That Aſſociation contains many Articles, the Principal whereof are the following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We will keep our ſelves firmly to the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion, and will not Elect any one for King who ſhall not make Profeſſion of the ſame Religion. 2. We will prevent as much as in us lies all Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Miſunderſtandings which may grow among the Members of the Republick; nor will we enter into any ſecret Practices againſt the Liberty of the Election, or which tend to the advancing any one to the Throne, or Acknowledge him for King, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he has been freely Elected by Free Voices, and by Unanimous Conſent, and has the General Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation. On the contrary, we will look upon as Enemies to this Country, all thoſe who ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge for King any Perſon who has not been Choſen after the ſaid manner. 3. To this purpoſe the Archbiſhop of <hi>Gneſna</hi> ſhall not Proclaim any one for King, unleſs he has firſt demanded of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties <hi>Three times,</hi> one after another, whether they are Content with his Election. 4. Though there may be in the Republick a Perſon capable to Wear the Crown with Honour, nevertheleſs, to avoid the Troubles that might ariſe from the Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Native of <hi>Poland</hi> to the Throne, the Deputies of the Leſſer <hi>Dyets</hi> ſhall bring along with them Inſtructions, in reference to this particular
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63304:140"/>Point, <hi>That every Native of the Country ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the Crown.</hi> Therefore the States In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves, by this Aſſociation, to look upon every Native of this Country, who ſhall Aſpire to the Crown, as a <hi>Publick Enemy,</hi> and likewiſe all ſuch as ſhall Acknowledge him for their King. 5. If any Forreign Potentate, or Grandee of <hi>Poland,</hi> ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to Advance any one to the Throne by Foul or Unlawful Means, to the Deſtruction of the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges and Immunities of their Country, the States ſhall Unite themſelves from this time forward a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch Potentates, and Promiſe Joyntly to venture their Lives and Fortunes in Defence of their Liberties. 6. We will preſerve an Inviolable Peace with thoſe who Profeſs a Religion different from that of the Kingdom, and every one ſhall be maintained in their Rights and Priviledges, except the <hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Mennonites.</hi> 7. The time of the Election is ſixed from the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> to the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> incluſively. 8. The Pretentions of the Royal Family ſhall be remitted to the <hi>Dyet</hi> for the Election. 9. The uſual Place appointed for the Election between <hi>Warſaw</hi> and <hi>Woba,</hi> ſhall be Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd according to Cuſtom; there ſhall be Erected a Building for the Deputies, and all requiſite Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations taken for the Security of their Perſons, either going in, or coming out. 10. Whereas the Army has entred into a Confederacy, for want of Pay, and that it is neceſſary that their Aſſociation ſhould be broken, we not only Promiſe them a ſpeedy Payment, but Authorize the Particular <hi>Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets</hi> to find out neceſſary Funds for that purpoſe. 11. Becauſe the New Regulation, drawn up for the Charge of the Artillery, is not ſufficient, the Treaſurer of the Crown ſhall ſupply what is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by vertue of the Eſtabliſhment made in the Year 1659. 12. The Cardinal ſhall, during his Regency, Chooſe, for his Counſellors, ſome of the
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:63304:141"/>Senate and Nobility. Laſtly, Deputies ſhall be Choſen to appoint good Winter Quarters to ſuch of the Souldiers, as ſhall give Obedience to the Crown General, and to Pay them what is their Due; to Reckon with the Army, and Regulate all Affairs which concern the Salt-Mines.</p>
            <p>Deputies were immediately ſent to the Army, to endeavour to break the Union, and oblige them to return to the Obedience of Count <hi>Jablonowsky</hi> Mareſhal of the Crown. They offered to Pay their Arrears, provided they would Diſunite them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: But they returned Anſwer, That though they ſhould receive full Satisfaction upon their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, they would not break off their Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy before the Election of a New King: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Treaty broke off, and the Deputies of the Republick retir'd to <hi>Leopold,</hi> where they made a Solemn Proteſtation againſt the Proceedings of the Army; which being ſent to the Primate, was Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Diſperſed into all the Provinces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to let them ſee they had left no Stone unturn'd to bring the Rebels to the Obedience of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. The Cardinal held a Great Council upon this Subject; where it was Reſolv'd. That no Quarters ſhould be allow'd to any Troops but thoſe, who remained Faithful under the Command of the Crown General; and then, if the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated Troops offer'd to take up their Quarters near <hi>Leopold,</hi> or elſewhere, they ſhould be driven out by Force.</p>
            <p>This Reſolution did not Diſcourage the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated Army; they gave an Oath of Fidelity to their New General <hi>Baronowsky,</hi> who cauſed a New Standard to be made, like that of the Crown Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, having Painted upon it <hi>Two Griffins</hi> holding <hi>Two Scimitters</hi> in their Claws, with theſe Words, <hi>Pro Patria</hi> under one of them, and <hi>Pro Exercitu</hi>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:63304:141"/>under the other. The <hi>Tartars</hi> being got together to the Number of 30000 Men, Introduc'd a great Convoy of Proviſion into <hi>Caminieck;</hi> and having notice of the Confuſion of the Affairs of <hi>Poland,</hi> made an Invaſion into <hi>Volhinia,</hi> carrying away a Great Number of People into Slavery; But the Confederate Troops having purſued them, Charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with ſo much Vigour, that they Routed them, and Retook a good Part of the Booty, and of the Poor People deſign'd for Captivity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lithuanians</hi> had Confederated themſelves as well as the <hi>Poles,</hi> and had refuſed the ſame offers, which exaſperated Prince <hi>Sapieha</hi> their General to ſuch a degree, that he undertook to Reduce them to their Duty by Force; but the Confederates de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended themſelves with ſo much Bravery, that Prince <hi>Sapieha</hi> was forced to return with conſiderable Loſs. This Diſgrace put him upon Negociations, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gained Monſieur <hi>Criſpin</hi> Vayvode of <hi>VVitepſc,</hi> one of the Chiefs of the Army, the reſt followed his Example, and the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Army returned to their Duty upon the following Conditions. 1. That there ſhould be a Perpetual Amneſty for all that had been done to that very inſtant. 2. That the Prince ſhould forthwith Pay them the one half of their Arrears, due from the Republick, out of his own Revenues. 3. That the General ſhould Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, upon his Honour, not to Moleſt any one of the Fraternity, from the Higheſt Officer to the Meaneſt Souldier. 4. That on their ſide they ſhould ingage, by an Authentick Writing, immediately to quit the Confederacy into which they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. 5. And to ſubmit themſelves to the Grand Marſhal, and obey his Orders. 6. And laſtly, That for the future they ſhould never enter into any other Confederacy. This Treaty was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> and all the Officers and Soldiers made their Submiſſion to Prince <hi>Sapieha.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="262" facs="tcp:63304:142"/>
            <p>This Reunion of the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> weakned very much the Confederated Troops, and diſpoſed them to hearken to ſome new Terms that were offer'd them ſometime after, and to return to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience of their former General, as it will be hereafter mention'd.</p>
            <p>All the World was ſurpris'd at the Proceedings of the <hi>Poles;</hi> and few would have thought that the miſerable condition of their Affairs abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring a King, a Private Intereſt would have prevailed ſo far upon them, as to oblige them to defer the Election of a Succeſſor to <hi>Sobiesky</hi> till <hi>May</hi> next. The <hi>Poles</hi> may ſay what they pleaſe, to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie this Reſolution, all their Reaſons are but a thin Varniſh over a Private Sordid Intereſt which Ruled them; for, the true Grounds of this Delay was, only to give time to many Princes to put in for their Crown, and make an Intereſt with them to obtain it, which cannot be done, without ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring away amongſt them Vaſt Sums of Money. This Conſideration moved ſometime ago a Grave Senator to Propoſe in the <hi>Dyet,</hi> to follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Cardinals, who Choſe always an Old Pope; and, to ſet forth, in a very Eloquent Speech, the Advantage that the Nobility would receive from Frequent Elections: But he was Anſwer'd, That he was miſtaken in his Politicks, for no Old Man would ſpend ſuch Sums of Money he had ſpoken of, and therefore his Project was Impracticable. The Inconveniencies of Elections and Interreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nums are ſo great, that 'tis likely the <hi>Poles</hi> would have long ago made the Crown Hereditary, in one Family, under a very Limitted Power, were it not for the Conſideration of the Money that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Candidates for their Crown muſt needs bring into their Kingdom.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Candidates began to make Parties; and, notwithſtanding the Natives of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:63304:142"/>were Excluded, by an Article of the Aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion afore mention'd, Prince <hi>James,</hi> and Prince <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> his Brother appear'd amongſt the others who made Intereſt for the Throne. They had for Competitors, the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> Prince <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is</hi> of <hi>Baden,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrrain;</hi> for the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi> would not appear, and order'd his Miniſter, the Abbot <hi>Scarlati,</hi> to Sollicit for Prince <hi>James.</hi> The Diviſions in the Royal Family were very favourable to Forreign Candidates, but they were happily extinguiſhed by the Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Prince <hi>James</hi> with his Mother, and thereby their Intereſt, which was divided before, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united, and Prince <hi>Alexander</hi> quitted his Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. The Primate contributed much to this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, which gave occaſion to believe, that he was not ſo deeply ingaged in the Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> as it was at firſt reported, and as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared afterwards. Prince <hi>James</hi> wanted neither Merit nor Money, and yet by an unaccountable Fatality, he was not much belov'd by the <hi>Poles,</hi> tho they had been Witneſſes of his Valour in ſeveral Rencounters. It was thought that the Emperor would have Declared for that Prince, becauſe he had the Honour to be His Imperial Majeſties Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law; but the Imperial Court was always upon the Reſerve; and what hapned in the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſhewed, that the Emperor was Engaged for another.</p>
            <p>The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> is certainly endowed with Excellent Qualities; and tho he has not met at the Court of <hi>France</hi> the Encouragement or Reward he deſerved, and though the Moſt Chriſtian King has not thought fit to truſt him with the Command of his Armies, yet all the World owns that he was very Worthy of that Great Employment: And moſt are of Opinion, that the <hi>French</hi> King was Afraid of his Capacity. Whatever it be, the
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:63304:143"/>King of <hi>Poland</hi> was no ſooner Dead, but the King of <hi>France</hi> thought of Promoting the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti</hi> to the Throne; and the Abbot of <hi>Polignac,</hi> his Miniſter, in his Speech to the <hi>Dyet</hi> that was in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt,</hi> Magnify'd very much the Zeal and Affection the King, his Maſter, had always had for the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the Republick; and gave ſome hints, to let them underſtand, that his Kindneſs was ſo Great, as to have Choſen a Succeſſor to their King wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their Crown. This was not expreſſed in plain Terms, for it was not time to do it: but he began few days after his Cabal, and made uſe of ſuch Artifices, to render the Royal Family Odious to the People, that the Queen was oblig'd to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him Her Preſence, and to Complain of him to the King of <hi>France,</hi> who diſown'd, in Publick, the Conduct of his Miniſter, though likely it was Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in Secret. The <hi>French</hi> knowing that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is the beſt Recommendation in <hi>Poland,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> was Perſwaded to Sell, or rather Mortgage his Eſtate; and the <hi>French</hi> King Remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Vaſt Sums of Money to His Miniſters, which Gained him ſo great a Party, that the Houſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtria</hi> thought it was high time to think of Prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Election, and therefore to redouble their Intreague.</p>
            <p>If Merit alone had been ſufficient to Raiſe a Prince to the Throne of <hi>Poland,</hi> there is no doubt but Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> would have carry'd the Crown; but His Highneſs wanting Money, his Party was ſo inconſiderable, that when the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came on, they were not taken notice of: and as to the young Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> neither the Great Actions of his Father, nor the Letter of the Queen his Mother to the Senate, was able to gain her Friends enough to ſtand it out againſt Prince <hi>James,</hi> and Prince of <hi>Conti.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="265" facs="tcp:63304:143"/>
            <p>The Winter was ſpent in Intreagues, and a great many Libels came out upon the Subject, ſome Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for Prince <hi>James,</hi> others for the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti,</hi> and others againſt both. The Nephew of Prince <hi>Sapieha</hi> was then at <hi>Paris,</hi> and having ſpent his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was Arreſted for Debt. The Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> having Notice thereof, came himſelf to the Priſon, Paid all his Debts, and gave him what Money he wanted to return home. This young Gentleman was ſo ſenſible of the Generoſity of that Prince, and of the Civility wherewith he had accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Service, that he Proclaimed it in <hi>Poland,</hi> and ingaged his Unckle into his Intereſt. However, Prince <hi>James</hi> ſeemed to have the Stronger Party, till the Death of the late King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which happen'd on the <hi>17th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1697. That Prince, who knew what Pretenſions the <hi>Poles</hi> have upon <hi>Livonia,</hi> was againſt the Election of any Foreign Prince, but eſpecially the Prince of <hi>Conti;</hi> and as on the other ſide, the Republick was obliged to have a great regard to the Recommendation of that Prince; 'tis believed Prince <hi>James</hi> would have been Elected, for many of thoſe who appear'd af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards againſt him, ſeem'd the moſt Zealous for his Intereſts.</p>
            <p>The time of the Election drawing nigh, the Queen thought fit to Remove a Second time from <hi>VVarſaw</hi> to <hi>Dantzick,</hi> to avoid the Troubles that were occaſion'd by her Preſence in the laſt Diet; and, in the mean time, Prince <hi>James</hi> with Count <hi>Jablonowsky</hi> General of the Crown, and all the Party of the Emperor did their utmoſt to Ruin the Intereſt of the Prince of <hi>Conti;</hi> and becauſe they ſuſpected the Rebellion of the Army to be fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and incouraged by the <hi>French,</hi> the Queen gave a Great Sum of Money to the Crown-Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to endeavour to break off their Confederacy, and thereupon a New Negotiation was ſet on
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63304:144"/>foot with the Ringleaders of the Troops, in which the Accompts of their Arrears were Adjuſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their own Deputies and thoſe of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and all other Points were ſo far ſetled, that every body thought their Confederacy at an end; However, the Treaty broke off at the Inſtigation of one of their Officers, who ſpread in the Army, That the Crown-General had Declared, That he would Cut off the Heads of their General, and of ſome others: Whereupon they declared, They would hearken to no Accommodation; and <hi>Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowsky</hi> Publiſhed a Manifeſto, containing the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the Army for continuing in this Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy, and reſolved to take up their Quarters in Great <hi>Poland,</hi> and Royal <hi>Pruſſia.</hi> The Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Republick at <hi>Leopold,</hi> upon Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid Manifeſto, Declared, That it was contrary to the Laws of the Kingdom; Adjudged it an Act of Rebellion; and Publiſh'd a Decree, by which they Declared the Confederated Troops <hi>Rebels,</hi> and Enemies to their Country. This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration frighted moſt of the Troops, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them to demand another Conference with the Deputies of the Republick; and, in ſhort, they made their Submiſſion to the Crown-General, on the <hi>11th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> 1697, in the Great Church of the <hi>Bernardins</hi> at <hi>Lemberg. Baronowsky,</hi> Mareſhal of the Confederates Begg'd Pardon, with an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Voice, at the General's Feet, touching the Foot-ſtool of his Seat with his Forehead, and Kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Feet, under which he put the Standard, which he had Illegally ſet put. Their Articles of Confederacy were torn to pieces, which being done, <hi>Te Deum</hi> was Sung, and the Day concluded with a Noble Feaſt at the Crown General's Palace, where <hi>Baronowsky</hi> and other Officers were Nobly Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
            <pb n="267" facs="tcp:63304:144"/>
            <p>Though the Emperour had hitherto appeared in the Intereſt of Prince <hi>James,</hi> the Queen of <hi>Poland</hi> thought to Write in his behalf, both to His Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Majeſty, and to the Empreſs; and much about that time, a Letter, pretended to have been Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Abbot of <hi>Polignac</hi> to Monſieur <hi>Chateau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neuf,</hi> Ambaſſador of <hi>France</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> was diſpatched through <hi>Poland,</hi> and did the <hi>French</hi> a great prejudice. This Letter was Written in the Year 1695, and Intercepted by a Party of <hi>Germans,</hi> ſo that it was brought to the Emperour, who thought fit to Communicate it to the Senate. The Abbot giving an Account in the Letter of the Ill Condition of the Affairs of <hi>Poland;</hi> tells Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>Chateauneuf,</hi> That the <hi>Turks</hi> had no reaſon to be afraid of them, and quit their Enterpriſes againſt <hi>Hungary,</hi> to oppoſe a <hi>People, who,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can do them no harm,</hi> becauſe of their Diviſions: And it contains ſome odd Reflections on the King, and the Crown-General, as if they had known, and been glad that he ſhould ſerve the <hi>Turks</hi> as Spy. This Letter did ſo highly incenſe the <hi>Poles,</hi> that it was very much inſiſted, that the Abbot of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignac</hi> might be compelled to declare, whether he had done it by his Maſters Order, or of his own head? and that if he did it by Order of the King of <hi>France,</hi> he might be Expelled the Kingdom, as the Miniſter of a Prince Enemy of the Republick: but that if it did appear that he had committed that Villanous Fact without any Orders, that ſuch a Puniſhment might be Inflicted upon him as the Laws Ordained for the Puniſhment of Traytors.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour deny'd the Fact, and prepared a Writing to diſown the Letter, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to prove, that it was Forg'd by the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of <hi>France;</hi> but, as his Party grew ſo ſtrong as to make him fear nothing, as to the Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Impreſſions that Letter might have
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:63304:145"/>wrought upon the <hi>Poles,</hi> his Apology was never Publiſh'd: which Silence has Corroborated all the Proofs the Imperialiſts Alledg'd to Convince the Senate of its being Genuine. The Abbot of <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teauneuf</hi>'s Brother, to the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſador at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople</hi> arriv'd about that time at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> being ſent by the <hi>French</hi> King to aſſiſt <hi>Polignac</hi> in his Negotiation, and temper a little his Eagerneſs and Paſſion, which had been like to prejudice the Affairs of his Maſter. This New Miniſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the Promiſe <hi>Polignac</hi> had made to the <hi>Poles,</hi> and added ſome others, in relation to an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Peace with the <hi>Turks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The time of the Election approaching, the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Dyets</hi> were held in the uſual Form, and broke up with more Tranquility than was expected. The Nobility of the Palatinate of <hi>Cracow</hi> made an Act of Aſſociation, whereby they Promiſed upon Oath, mutually to aſſiſt each other, and not to ſuffer themſelves to be Corrupted by any Party, but on the contrary to Procure and Promote the Common Good of their Country with Unanimity and Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
            <p>The number of the Competitors was not much increas'd; for, beſides theſe I have already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, no other had yet appear'd except the Prince of <hi>Newburg;</hi> but few days before the Great <hi>Dyet</hi> began, all the World was Surpriſed to ſee Prince <hi>Livio Odeſchalchi,</hi> Nephew to <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. putting in for the Crown, for no body thought he carry'd his Pretenſions ſo high. However, he was like to outbid all the reſt: And that the Reader may know upon what account, it will not be improper to ſet at large in this place the Propoſals he made to the Republick, which are as follows.</p>
            <pb n="269" facs="tcp:63304:145"/>
            <p>
               <q>SEeing the Magnanimous Prince <hi>Odeſchalchi,</hi> Nephew to Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> XI. of Glorious Memory, is one of thoſe that have conceived an Extraordinary Tenderneſs and Affection for the Moſt Serene Republick, as well out of his own Inclination, as an Imitatation of his Unckle, he makes bold to be one of the Candidates at the New Election of a King. Not that he has any Deſign to Croſs the Royal Princes of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> no leſs Illuſtrious for their own Vertues, than for the Heroick Atchievements of their Deceaſed Glorious Father; or to oppoſe thoſe other Pretenders to the Crown, whether Natives or Forreigners: But, if it ſhould come to paſs, through any unfortunate event, that none of thoſe Competitors ſhould be Advanced to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Throne, and that the Magnanimous Prince <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſchalchi</hi> ſhould be Preferr'd before all the reſt, he would willingly ſubmit his Perſon, and all that he has in the World, to the Moſt Serene Republick. And moreover, ſeeing he ſhould not be Supported by any Forreign Prince, he ſhould be Solely Beholding for his Election to the Good Will of the Illuſtrious <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nation, and will Bind himſelf, as a Teſtimony of his Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment, to the following Conditions.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">

               <q>II. That he will, in no Manner whatſoever, Violate the Precious Liberty of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but rather defend it, upon all occaſions, with the Expence of his own Blood.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="270" facs="tcp:63304:146"/>
            <p n="3">
               <q>III. That for the Payment of the Souldiers, he will Supply the Republick with Eight Milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Florins</hi> in <hi>Poliſh</hi> Money, before he ſet his Foot in the Kingdom.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <q>IV. That he will Redeem <hi>Elbing</hi> from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> by Reimburſing the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for which it was formerly Mortgaged to him.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <q>V. That he will uſe his beſt Endeavours to recover <hi>Caminiek,</hi> and other Territories the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi> have Uſurp'd from the Moſt Serene Republick.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <q>VI. That to Diſcharge the Republick from the Aſſignments that are uſually allotted to the New Queen, he will never Marry: or if the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deſires he ſhould, he will accept of ſuch a Wife as they ſhall think fit.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="7">
               <q>VII. That he will take Care for the future the Army ſhall be Regularly Paid.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="8">
               <q>VIII. That he will at his own Charges Found a Colledge at <hi>Rome</hi> for 25 <hi>Poliſh</hi> Gentlemen, and as many <hi>Lithuanians,</hi> with a ſufficient Revenue for their Maintenance according to their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="9">
               <q>IX. That if he comes to Die without Iſſue, the Republick ſhall be the Sole Heireſs of all his Eſtate of Money and Lands, as alſo of all his Rich and Coſtly Moveables.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>X. For the Performance of all theſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he is ready to ingage, by an Authentick
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:63304:146"/>Act, to the Moſt Serene Republick, all his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Lands in the <hi>Milaneſe,</hi> as alſo the Dukedoms of <hi>Ceri, Bracciano,</hi> and <hi>Palo,</hi> the Marquiſate of <hi>Roncofredi,</hi> and the County of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tejano,</hi> with all the Forts, Arſenals, and Braſs Canon that are in thoſe Places. He will Ingage likewiſe, all the Sums of Money which he has at Intereſt at <hi>Rome, Naples, Venice, Genoa, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid, Amſterdam,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>XI. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> The Envoy of Prince <hi>Odeſchalchi</hi> to the <hi>Dyet,</hi> is ready to make it Evident to whoſoever ſhall deſire it, by Proofs which he has by him, and the Teſtimony of ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Quality, that theſe Lands, and Sums in Bank, amount to above Twenty Millions of Florins, <hi>Poliſh</hi> Money, beſides his Moveables, Gold and Silver, Plate, Jewels, Medals, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Paintings.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are the Great Offers with which Don <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vio Odeſcalchi</hi> expected to dazle the Eyes of the <hi>Poles;</hi> and likely he would have carry'd his Point, had he not been Out-bid by ſome other Prince. To this New Candidate I muſt add Count <hi>Jablo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowsky</hi> General of the Crown, Prince <hi>Sapicha</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of <hi>Lithuania,</hi> and Prince <hi>Lubiomirsky</hi> Grand Mareſhal of the Court; but, the Event has ſhown that they did Caball for Others, and not for Themſelves.</p>
            <p>All the Particular <hi>Dyets</hi> being Held, and the Fort and Bridges, which uſually are wont to be Built upon theſe Occaſions over the <hi>Viſtula,</hi> and all other Preparations being in a Readineſs, the <hi>Dyet</hi> began the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> with the <hi>Maſs of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Celebrated by Signior <hi>Davia</hi> the <hi>Popes Nuncio.</hi> The Biſhop of <hi>Ploskow</hi> made a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63304:147"/>wherein he Exhorted the Aſſembly to have no other Intereſt but the Good of their Country; and to lay aſide the Conſideration of all Private Advantages, with a Reſolution to Advance to the Throne the Perſon whom they ſhould deem moſt Worthy of the Crown. The Sermon being over, they repair'd to the Place of the Election to Chooſe a Mareſhal, but they ſoon perceiv'd the Spirit of Diviſion was more Powerful amonſt them, than the Chriſtian and Judicious Advice of the Biſhop of <hi>Ploskow;</hi> ſo that the Election of their Preſident was put off till the Firſt of <hi>June,</hi> upon Pretence that the Aſſembly was not Compleat: And, in the mean time Monſieur <hi>Omienisky,</hi> who was Mareſhal of the <hi>Preliminary Dyet,</hi> was deſir'd to perform the Function of Mareſhal or Preſident till another was Elected. One of the Palatines of <hi>Leſſer Poland</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to Enquire into the Authors and Abetters of the Confederacy of the Army, before they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to the Election of a King, or of a Mareſhal; but this Propoſal, and ſome other of this Nature, put the Aſſembly into ſuch a Heat, that the Mareſhal was obliged to Adjourn them to the next day.</p>
            <p>The Choice of a Mareſchal took up the <hi>Dyet</hi> from the <hi>Firſt</hi> of <hi>June</hi> to the <hi>16th,</hi> becauſe of the Two Parties ſtriving to gain this Point. The <hi>French</hi> were for Count <hi>Bielinsky</hi> Grand Chamberlain, and the other Party for <hi>Czartorisky</hi> Son of the Grand General of <hi>Poland;</hi> and becauſe the Preſident of the <hi>Dyet</hi> has a Great Influence over the Palatines, they perplexed the Affairs ſo much on both ſides, that it was thought at firſt the <hi>Dyet</hi> would break up for want of a Mareſhal: At laſt, the Suffrages being Collected and Told, the Plurality was found for Count <hi>Bielinsky,</hi> who was thereupon Proclaimed Mareſhal. This was a Tryal of Skill and Strength between the Two Parties; and therefore the Court of <hi>Vienna</hi> had Judiciouſly foreſeen, from the Mighty
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:63304:147"/>Oppoſition they met with from the <hi>French</hi> Faction, that the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> was like to carry the Crown, unleſs he was opoſed by a more conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Rival than Prince <hi>James,</hi> for then all other Parties vaniſh'd away. Therefore the Emperour made a Propoſal to the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who was then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> to put in for the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> aſſuring him of a Powerful Aſſiſtance. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor being a Young Prince, was eaſily dazled with the proſpect of a Crown, and accepted, with all imaginable Satisfaction the Propoſals of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour. His Religion was not ſo great an Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle as one would have thought; all his Doubts and Difficulties were eaſily remov'd in Two or Three Conferences he had, <hi>pro forma,</hi> with the Biſhop of <hi>Javarin</hi> his Couſin; and all other Meaſures being taken with a great Privacy, the Elector took <hi>Poſt</hi> for <hi>Dreſden,</hi> where he Arriv'd on the <hi>11d</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> and having Muſter'd his Forces, which had been drawn up, to the Number of 7 or 8000 Men, upon pretence of going into <hi>Hungary,</hi> Marched for <hi>Sile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia,</hi> upon the Frontiers of <hi>Poland.</hi> All the World was Surpriz'd at this March; but the Baron of <hi>Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> who arriv'd at <hi>Warſaw</hi> at the ſame time, as Envoy Extraordinary from <hi>Saxony,</hi> having Publiſht his Maſters Deſign to Stand Candidate for the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> perceived that they had been Groſsly Miſtaken, and that they would have to deal with a Powerful Competitor. 'Tis to be obſerv'd, that the <hi>French</hi> thought at firſt, that the Elector was about to Diſturb the Peace of <hi>Germany,</hi> it being given out, that he was Diſſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Emperour, and recalled his Troops from <hi>Hungary;</hi> and therefore they were like Thunder-ſtruck't at the <hi>Propoſals</hi> of the Baron <hi>do Fleming,</hi> which were as follow.</p>
            <pb n="274" facs="tcp:63304:148"/>
            <p n="1">1. The Family of <hi>Saxony</hi> is ſo Illuſtrious, that Emperours of <hi>Germany</hi> have been Choſen out of it, and among others, <hi>Otho</hi> III. who raiſed the Duke of <hi>Poland</hi> to Regal Dignity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The preſent Elector is in the Flower of his Youth, not being above 27 years of Age, endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all Military Virtues, of which he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſufficient Proofs upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> and chiefly in <hi>Hungary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. He has Imbraced the Catholick Religion, as his Envoy is ready to prove.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He has but one only Son, to whom he will leave the Electorate of <hi>Saxony,</hi> with ſeveral other Territories, ſo that he will be no Charge to the Republick, the Elector not ſeeking the Crown only for himſelf, but out of a Deſign of Advancing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and Defending the Liberties and Priviledges of the Nobility.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His Electoral Highneſs will have no regard to a ſordid and particular Intereſt of Vacant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, but only to Virtue and Merit.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Immediately after the Election he will give Ten Millions, not in Paper, but in Ready Money to Pay the Crown Debts.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He Promiſes to take <hi>Caminieck</hi> with his own Men and Artillery.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He will Unite the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>krain, Walachia</hi> and <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia</hi> to <hi>Poland.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="275" facs="tcp:63304:148"/>
            <p n="9">9. To prevent the dangers of any War, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Common-wealth may be threatned, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, if required by the Senate, to Aſſiſt the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick with 6000 Men at his own Charge.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If the Exchange of any one of his Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Countries, in Lieu of any Province of <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> be more for the Conveniency of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, he promiſes to conſent to it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. He will Erect an <hi>Academy</hi> in <hi>Poland</hi> for the Inſtruction of the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Nobility in the <hi>Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> and all Military Exerciſes.</p>
            <p n="12">12. He will reform the Coyn of the Kingdom, and Reſtore Trade, to which purpoſe his City of <hi>Leipſick</hi> may be greatly Serviceable.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Frontiers ſhall be put into a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and Men kept on Foot in the Exerciſe of Arms.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The Republick has nothing but good to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the Election of His Highneſs; and the Pope's Nuncio, and the Emperour's Ambaſſadour will Certifie for him, as to the matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>Theſe Conditions being more Advantageous to the Republick than any that had been yet made, 'tis not to be wonder'd at, if ſo Great a Party of <hi>Polan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> gave their Voice for the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> though he had not time enough to purchaſe a <hi>Party</hi> with Money. The <hi>Pope</hi>'s Nuntio Anſwer'd, That his Religion ought not to be an Obſtacle to his Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſeeing he had Imbrac'd the Catholick Faith, as it appeared by a Certificate under the Hand and
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:63304:149"/>Seal of the Biſhop of <hi>Javarin</hi> which he knew. The Biſhop of <hi>Paſſau,</hi> Ambaſſad or of the Emperour, appeared publickly for His Electoral Highneſs; and, in ſhort, his <hi>Party</hi> grew, in few days, ſo ſtrong, as to exceed the <hi>French,</hi> as we are going to Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>The Election of a Mareſchal, and ſome other <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liminary</hi> things took up the <hi>Dyet</hi> till the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>June;</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Nuncio had publick Audience that day; and the next day the Emperour's Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour had his; the <hi>22d</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Ambaſſadour was heard, and afterward the Envoy of the Elector of <hi>Brandenburgh;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Dyet</hi> could not go on with the Election of a King till the <hi>25th.</hi> The Royal Family's <hi>Party</hi> made a Fair Appearance at the beginning, ſeveral of the <hi>Palatinates</hi> having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the Electors the Merits of <hi>Prince James,</hi> his Great Alliances, and ſeveral other things fit to engage the Republick to preſent him with their Crown: Others propoſed Don <hi>Livio Odeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalchi;</hi> but the <hi>French Party</hi> ſeemed ſtill more Numerous. The <hi>26th</hi> the <hi>Saxon Party</hi> grew ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, notwithſtanding the Intreagues of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,</hi> who Rode from one Squadron of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to the other, Recommending to their Choice the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conti;</hi> but his Competitors had ſuch a Majority, that it was thought the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> would have been <hi>Proclaimed</hi> that day. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the <hi>Partiality</hi> of the <hi>Primate</hi> was ſuch, that the Grandees quitted the Field that day, without coming to any Reſolution. They Met again the next day, being the <hi>27th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> and Reſolved not to Separate, till they had made an End of that Grand Affair. The Cardinal did his utmoſt to bring the Nobility to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conty</hi>'s <hi>Party,</hi> but his Endeavours were in vain; for, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a great many left him, and went over to the <hi>Saxons:</hi> yet, in Spite of all the Oppoſition, the

               <hi>Primate,</hi> at the Head of his Cabal, Ordered the Trumpets to Sound, and <hi>Proclaimed</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conti;</hi> and repairing, with all the haſt he could to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church, cauſed the Doors to be ſhut, and Sung <hi>Te Deum</hi> in the Dark. The Cardinal having left the Field, the Mareſchal of the Crown, the Crown-General, and the Heads of the <hi>Parties</hi> of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and <hi>Prince James, Proteſted</hi> againſt the Irregular and Violent Way of proceeding of the <hi>Primate,</hi> as contrary to the Laws and Freedom of Election; and having United themſelves, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Collect the Suffrages in a Legal Way, and afterwards <hi>Friderick Auguſtus</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> was <hi>Proclaimed</hi> King by the Biſhop of <hi>Cujavia,</hi> who immediately repair'd to the Great Church in <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,</hi> with the <hi>Saxon Party,</hi> where he cauſed <hi>Te De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> to be Sung, with the Uſual Ceremonies. The <hi>28th</hi> they repair'd again into the Field, and ſent for the Cardinal, who refus'd to come; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they ſent for the Baron <hi>de Fleming,</hi> to Treat with him about the <hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> and the Royal <hi>Diploma</hi> was order'd to be prepar'd. The Grand General cauſed an Act to be drawn up, and Sign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Field, whereby it Appeared, that there were but 80 <hi>Standards</hi> (or rather <hi>Squadrons</hi>) for the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conti,</hi> whereas there were 250 for the Elector of <hi>Saxony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Envoys of the other Competitors extreamly blamed the Conduct of the Cardinal Primate, for refuſing ſo much as to Propoſe any of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to the Republick, and for his Concealing a Letter from the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> in Favour of Prince <hi>James,</hi> containing an Expreſs Clauſ, That <hi>Poland</hi> muſt expect a <hi>Declaration of War</hi> ſo ſoon as they have Elected the Prince of <hi>Conti.</hi> 'Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Partiality of this <hi>Prelate</hi> can hardly be match'd; for had he been ruled by the Intereſt
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:63304:150"/>of the Republick, as he ought to have been, he would have Declared for the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> as being the moſt Advantageous Choice the <hi>Poles</hi> could have made, conſidering the Riches and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of that Prince, who is able of Himſelf to Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> and Reſtore it to its former Dignity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Pacta Conventa</hi> being Drawn up, the Baron <hi>de Fleming</hi> repair'd in great Splendor on the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> to the Great Church in <hi>Warſaw,</hi> and Swore to them in his Maſter's Name.

The <hi>Reader</hi> will find an Account in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapters of the <hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> and an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of the moſt Principal Articles thereof; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I think fit to Inſert at Large in this place the <hi>Pacta Conventa</hi> Sworn by the Envoy of <hi>Saxony,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is ſome Additions made to them by reaſon of the Circumſtance of Time and Perſons.

            <p>Theſe Articles being Signed without exception, a great Embaſſy was appointed to go and offer the Crown to the Elector, who was already advanced to <hi>Tarnowits</hi> on the frontiers of <hi>Poland.</hi> The Son of the Grand General of the Crown, ten Senators and ſeventy Knights, attended by above 2000 Gentlemem were appointed for that Service. The Elector gave them Audience in the Fields near <hi>Tarnowits,</hi> under a very Rich Tent; and appear'd on that occaſion with an extraordinary Magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. The Ambaſſadors and Gentlemen of their Retinue paid him all reſpect as to their Prince, and kiſſed his Hand; and there was afterwards a noble Entertainment. The new King and the Biſhop of <hi>Paſſau</hi> Ambaſſador of the Emperor to the <hi>Dyet</hi> of <hi>Poland</hi> ſat at one Table, the Ambaſſadors and other Perſons of Principal quality were at another Table, and their Retinue at a third. After Dinner the king went with the Ambaſſadors to view his Forces that were encamped near that Place; and conferr'd the command thereof to the firſt Ambaſſador, who received it with all Submiſſion. The Speech of the ſaid Ambaſſador is ſo ſingular that I think fit to inſert it here, as well to give an example of the Eloquence of the <hi>Poles,</hi> as to ſhew what opinion they have of their Crown, which they think, it ſeems, above all other Crowns of the World.</p>

                  <p>THE Moſt Serene Republick of <hi>Poland,</hi> which alone has preſerv'd her Ancient Liberty, and which, after ſo much Blood as has been drawn from her own Veins, may be called the Wonder of preceding Ages, gives you to underſtand, by our Mouths, That you
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:63304:152"/>have been Elected by our Free Suffrages, KING of <hi>Poland,</hi> Grand Duke of <hi>Lithuania, Ruſſia, Pruſſia, Maſſovia, Samogittia, Kiovia, Volhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Podolia, Polaquia, Livonia, Smolensko, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> and <hi>Czernicovia.</hi> 'Tis upon you, Moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> that we have caſt our Eyes, and whom we Imbrace and Cheriſh, not only for the ſake of ſo many Emperours, Kings, and Great Captains from whom you are Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, but for the ſake of thoſe Heroick Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, that render your Name and Reputation ſo bright and glorious to the World, beſides an Infinite Number of Signal Endowments that make you worthy of a Scepter. Could our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick miſtake her ſelf in ſo Noble a Choice? Has ſhe not Choſen a Hero Belov'd of Heaven and Earth? A Hero who has Won ſo many Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories from the Barbarians, and who is laden with ſo many Laurels? Has ſhe not preferr'd <hi>Auguſtus</hi> before all the reſt? who, before he was Choſen to Supply her Vacant Throne, ſo well deſerv'd to fill it by His Valour, Fame, and Eternal Honour? Certainly we could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope for Comfort after ſo many Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which we were no longer able to bear, but in expectation that your Reign will put an end to them. You have Triumph'd, Moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene King, over the <hi>Turks,</hi> Triumph now over the Hearts of the <hi>Polanders:</hi> Stretch forth over our Crown your Armes ſo well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtom'd to Vanquiſh the Infidels.

Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that has always been ſo Warlike, and Nurs'd up in Armes from her Cradle, ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold You Imitating, if not Surpaſſing, the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roick Actions of Your Anceſtors, endow'd with a Martial Heart, breathing only what the Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt Bravery inſpires into your Breaſt, and full of Majeſtick Sweetneſs. She will admire Your Generoſity, and all thoſe Royal Manners, that muſt needs force the World to confeſs, that 'tis only in Your Breaſt where Majeſty Reſides.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, She will behold and admire You, not only for Your Natural Endowments, and thoſe Rare <hi>Perfections</hi> You have Acquir'd in Your Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Family, and in Climates where Your Valour has been ſignaliz'd but for Your Imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our Religion. This is that Light which renders Heaven Serene, and diſſipated thoſe Clouds and Tempeſts which at firſt obſcur'd Your Free Election. Moſt Fortunate Prince, You have Rejoyc'd the Holy City; You have paid Your Ancient Mother the Honour due to Her, and <hi>Saxony</hi> is become, by Your Change of Religion, a Thouſand times more Illuſtrious than by Your perpetual Victories. By abandoning the Errours of Your Country, You have found Crowns amongſt Forreigners. There were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Competitors, Excellent Princes, and of great Worth, who Aſpir'd to the Crown of <hi>Poland,</hi> but none of 'em who had Heaven a ſharer in the Conteſt. You only were the Perſon who began with God, and for Your <hi>Premium</hi> carry'd the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:63304:153"/>Prize of that Faith which You had Recover'd. That thing once Confirm'd to us, we gave You our Free Suffrages with all our Hearts, and have Proclaimed You to Reign over us. We are Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant whether You will, or will not be our King, but are Aſſur'd that You are Valiant, Warlike, Affable, Pious, Catholick, and give You our Hearts, our Prayers, our Tongues, and all we have in the World. Our Republick, now Your own, whoſe Fame is ſo far ſpread, Venerates, Loves Your Perſon with an entire Affection, and deſires Your Preſence, as one whom ſhe has Choſen for her King, or rather as one whom God Himſelf has Choſen, and whom we as Frankly and Freely Receive. What We have done, not in the Dark, but in the View of Heaven, this Day we here Confirm by theſe Letters. We Invite Your Majeſty, after Your having been Proclaim'd, not by Tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Factions, nor by the Fury of Inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Raſhneſs, or that we had put our Crown to Sale, but by the Unbyaſs'd Wiſhes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of the People, who Invite Your Majeſty with a Profound Sincerity of Heart, and at Ardency of Deſire not to be expreſſed. Come then, Bleſſed Prince, ſince God has ſo Decre'd it, ſince <hi>Poland</hi> ſo Earneſtly Deſires it, ſince <hi>Rome</hi> Rejoyces at it, ſince <hi>Germany</hi> Approves the Choice, ſince <hi>Europe</hi> applauds it; ſince all the World, the Barbarians only excepted, ſend up their loudeſt Acclamation to Heaven in teſtimony of their Content. Chriſtendom is preparing for Your Majeſtys immortal Renown, <hi>Aſia</hi> her Spoils, and <hi>Poland</hi> a Crown invironed with Lawrels. May all Your Undertakings proſper: appear in the midſt of us and Reign over us. And as for my ſelf in particular, how
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:63304:154"/>happy am I, upon the Frontiers of my Country, and at the head of this noble Embaſſy to give Your Majeſty the ſame ſuffrages, which I had given You before in the Field of <hi>Mars.</hi> How happy am I to have been choſen to bring you the Tydings of Your being Proclaim'd. 'Tis ſo great an Honour for a noble <hi>Polonian</hi> that he could not wiſh a greater. Now then, after we have thus congratulated Your Majeſty, we will return and ſpread the report of Your Fame amongſt our Brethren. We will bleſs our ſelves for what we have ſeen, we will Publiſh what You are, and how great our Hopes in ſo Illuſtrious a Prince. Laſtly, we will declare Your Glory among the Nations, and all the Earth ſhall be full of Your Majeſty.</p>

            <p>This Speech is full of very high Compliments, for notwithſtanding the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> is a Prince endow'd with ſeveral good qualifications, yet, I dare ſay, all the accompliſhments attributed unto him by the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſador do very ſeldom meet together in a Prince ſo young as his Electoral Highneſs; therefore an ingenious Gentleman has very well obſerv'd, that the <hi>Poles</hi> thought fit to make uſe of theſe inſinuating flateries to inform their new Prince, what ſort of King they deſire, what ſort a Prince they expect he ſhould be, and in what manner they could wiſh he would deport him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf amongſt them, If this was their meaning I muſt excuſe their flatery and confeſs that it is the beſt uſe that can be made of it.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Party of the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> concerted Meaſures how to Support their Election, and the <hi>Cardinal Primate</hi> ſent a Letter to the Elector to compliment him out of the Throne; but the Letter being directed to the Elector of
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:63304:154"/>
               <hi>Saxony</hi> without mentioning King <hi>Elect</hi> of <hi>Poland,</hi> it was ſent back without being open'd. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of that Letter was to repreſent to his Electoral Highneſs that the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> had been Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animouſly choſen by the Nobility, whereas his Election was only ſupported by ſome few Men, and therefore they hoped from the Juſtice of his Electoral Highneſs that he would not trouble their Free Election. They proteſt to have a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for his Heroical Virtues, but that it was never their intention to Burthen his Serenity with the Publick Government of their Kingdom whilſt he was ſo Gloriouſly imploy'd againſt the Common Enemy.</p>
            <p>This Artifice having not ſucceeded as they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, they made a Proteſtation on the <hi>25th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> againſt all that ſhould be done by the Party of <hi>Saxony,</hi> but by Name againſt <hi>Staniſlaus, Jablonousky,</hi> Caſtelan, and <hi>Felix Potosky</hi> Polatine of <hi>Cracavia</hi> Grand General and Inferior General of the Crown, <hi>Joſeph Sluska</hi> Caſtellan of <hi>Vilna</hi> Inferior General of <hi>Lithuania, Stamſtaus, Dabsky,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cujavia,</hi> and ſeveral others, whom they Charge with a deſign to overturn the State, which as they ſay, appears by their openly protecting the Promoters of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy of the Army, their delaying the choice of a <hi>Mareſchal</hi> of the <hi>Dyet,</hi> and laſtly by Electing againſt the Laws obſerved in Election, a <hi>Lutheran</hi> for King, notwithſtanding the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi> had been Lawfully and Freely Elected, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by the <hi>Primate.</hi> They proteſt alſo againſt the <hi>Pacta Conventa</hi> which they preſumed to draw up, and cauſed 'em to be Sworn to by a <hi>Calviniſt</hi> Ambaſſador, the Sacrament being clandeſtinly expoſed. This is the Subſtance of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation; but tho' they are ſo poſitive in their Accuſations, the other Party, as we have ſeen,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:63304:155"/>pretends to have done nothing againſt the Laws of their Country, but on the contrary charge the <hi>Primate</hi> and his Party with irregular Proceedings, which after all is certainly true.</p>
            <p>The Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> went the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>July</hi> from <hi>Tarnowits</hi> to <hi>Picari,</hi> where he went to Church with the Ambaſſadors, being received and complimented at the Church Door by <hi>Monſieur Criſpin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Samogitia</hi> and Brother to the <hi>Lithuanian</hi> Ambaſſador, who carry'd the King Elect to the Place that was prepar'd for him near the Altar. There the King made a new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith and received the Communion from the hands of the Biſhop. After the Maſs, he Swore to the <hi>Pacta Conventa,</hi> and then <hi>Te Deum</hi> was ſung which was attended with the loud Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations of the People and other Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Joy.</p>
            <p>The next day his Majeſty treated the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Ambaſſadors, the Biſhop of <hi>Paſſau,</hi> and ſeveral other Lords in a Caſtle belonging to the Biſhop of <hi>Cracow,</hi> where he made the following Speech to the Nobility Aſſembled to Congratulate him.</p>

In the mean time the Biſhop of <hi>Cujavia</hi> in the King's Name, ſent out Circular Letters for a general <hi>Dyet</hi> to meet at <hi>Warſaw,</hi> and the <hi>Cardinal Primate</hi> Summoned another to meet the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis to be obſerved that the Party who Choſe the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> impowered their Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors to agree with him about the Number of the Forces that he was to bring into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till he was in the peaceable Poſeſſion of the Throne, and accordingly, the <hi>Saxon</hi> Troops that were in <hi>Sileſia</hi> Marched to <hi>Cracow,</hi> and Encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Neighbourhood of that City, into which the Elector made his entry the <hi>8th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> being received by the Inhabitants with all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable Demonſtrations of Joy. His Majeſty went directly to the Caſtle, which had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:63304:157"/>for his Reſidence during his ſtay at <hi>Lopſow,</hi> and called a great Council at which moſt of the Senators and Officers of State were preſent, where three things were Propos'd to be Conſider'd of. 1. What was fit to be done in relation to the <hi>Dyet</hi> Summoned by the <hi>Primate</hi> to meet at <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw</hi> the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt?</hi> 2. How to Pay the Army. 3. Whether the Mediation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> or any other forreign Prince ſhould be deſired or accepted? As to the firſt it was Reſolv'd not to permit the ſaid <hi>Dyet</hi> to meet, and that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Forces ſhould for that purpoſe March towards <hi>Warſaw,</hi> unleſs the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> and his Adherents did within a Fortnight, to be reckon'd form the ſecond of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> own the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> for King of <hi>Poland.</hi> 2. That the Caſtellan of <hi>Culm</hi> ſhould begin to pay the Army on the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> out of the Moneys provided by the Kings Orders. 3. And laſtly, that it was not proper to deſire to accept the Mediation of any Forreign Prince, ſeeing it might be lookt upon as a Tacit Conceſſion that the Election had not been duly made.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Provincial Dyets</hi> met in the mean time in order to ſend Deputies to the General <hi>Dyet</hi> Summon'd by the <hi>Primate,</hi> but ſeveral broke up without coming to any Reſolutions, and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as that of <hi>Warſaw,</hi> reſolved to ſend Deputies to aſſiſt at the Coronation of the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> which was appointed to be perform'd on the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> at <hi>Cracow.</hi> An Envoy of the <hi>Czar</hi> of <hi>Moſcovy</hi> arrived at <hi>Cracow</hi> about this time to Congratulate his Majeſtys Election, and offer him an Army to reduce the Rebels to his Obedience.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the March of the Elector, the <hi>Dyet</hi> call'd by the <hi>Primate</hi> met at <hi>Warſaw</hi> on the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:63304:157"/>
               <hi>26th.</hi> being compos'd for the moſt part of Members gained by the <hi>French</hi> Money, and ſo ſoon as they were together, one of the Deputies proteſted in the Name of the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> againſt all their Proceedings, but the other drawing their Sabres he was in great danger of being Kill'd, and forced to retire for his Security, ſo that ſome others who deſign'd to make the ſame proteſtation held their Tongue, and left the Aſſembly. This irregular <hi>Dyet</hi> having choſen their <hi>Mareſchal</hi> took upon them, to declare all thoſe that ſhould joyn with the Elector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> Enemies of their Country, and that their Eſtates ſhould be ſeis'd and Confiſcated. They enter'd alſo into an Aſſocation ingaging to ſtand by each other, and maintain the Authority of the <hi>Primate.</hi> It was reſolved alſo that the Elector ſhould be once more deſired to leave the Kingdom, and that upon his refuſal, Prince <hi>Sapieha</hi> whom they choſe General, ſhould march to <hi>Cracow</hi> and oblige him to quit that place by Force.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom being thus threatned with a Civil War, a great many Noblemen were for a new Election, which gave ſome hopes to Prince <hi>James,</hi> and oblig'd him to come <hi>Incognito</hi> to <hi>Gurau</hi> within five Leagues of <hi>Warſaw</hi> to confer with ſome of his moſt intimate Friends; but they ſaw no liklihood of Succeeding, conſidering the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſity of the two other Parties, and the Preſence of the Elector of <hi>Saxony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg,</hi> who has a great Intereſt in the Tranquillity of <hi>Poland,</hi> offer'd his Medation; and there were ſeveral Conferences between Prince <hi>Lubomirsky,</hi> whom the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> had appointed his Plenipotentiary, and the Cardinal Primate. The <hi>French</hi> Faction had no other Deſign in their Negotiations, than to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:63304:158"/>hinder, or at leaſt delay the Elector's Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for, though the Regent had call'd a New <hi>Dyet,</hi> to Meet the <hi>26th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> yet the <hi>Saxon</hi> Party were inform'd, That the Primate had ſent new Expreſſes to haſten the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi>'s departure from <hi>France,</hi> that he might Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive in <hi>Poland</hi> before that Day.</p>
            <p>This, and the Violent Proceedings of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, in Seizing the Caſtle of <hi>Warſaw,</hi> and turning out the <hi>Vayvode</hi> becauſe he was in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Party, gave a juſt and reaſonable Suſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the King and his Adherents, that theſe Conferences were only an Amuſement on purpoſe to gain Time, and therefore His Majeſty, with the Advice of the Great Men about Him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to proceed to His Coronation the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> according to the Reſolution for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly taken.</p>
            <p>There were Two Great Difficulties to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Cardinal was in Poſſeſſion of the Corps of the Late King, and the Laws of <hi>Poland</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, that it ſhould be Buryed the Day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Coronation of His Succeſſor; The <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> were mightily perplex'd, and did not know what to do in this Matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Regalia</hi> being kept in the Caſtle of <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cow,</hi> in a Place eſteem'd Sacred by the <hi>Poles,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Four Locks, the Keys whereof are Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Primate, the Great Treaſurer, and Two other Senators, that the ſame may not be Open'd but in the preſence of them Four: They did not know how to come at them, none of thoſe Men being in their Party: but after ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:63304:158"/>Conſultations, it was Reſolved, That theſe Formalities ought not to prevent the Great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages that the Republick expected from His Majeſty's Coronation, and that therefore the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequies of the Late King ſhould be made by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, and that the Door of the Place where the Regalia were kept, ſhould be broke open in the preſence of the Senators, and ſome other Great Men.</p>
            <p>This Reſolution being taken, the King made a Moſt Magnificent Entry into <hi>Cracow</hi> on the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> which it would be too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite here; The Palatines, Biſhops, Ambaſſadors, and the King Himſelf being on Horſeback moſt Richly Accoutred. The next day the Funeral of the Late King was performed, and on the <hi>15th</hi> His Majeſty was Crowned by the Biſhop of <hi>Cuja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi> Aſſiſted by ſeveral other Biſhops, in the Preſence of a Great Concourſe of the Nobility, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom were the Crown General, the Prince of <hi>Lubomirsky,</hi> and moſt of the Senators: It were tedious to repeat here the Ceremonies pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed on this Occaſion, and therefore we muſt Refer the <hi>Reader</hi> to the XIXth <hi>Chapter</hi> of this Book, which Treats at large of the King's Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. The Solemnity of the Day concluded with a Great Entertainment, with Firing of the Artillery of the place, and with Three Salvo's of all the <hi>Saxon</hi> Forces Incamp'd under the Walls of <hi>Cracow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Day His Majeſty being Cloathed in His Royal Robes, went, in Great <hi>Pomp</hi> to the <hi>Town-Houſe,</hi> and being Set upon a Throne Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted before the Houſe, the Magiſtrates came to Aſſure Him of their Fidelity, and <hi>Preſented</hi> Him with the Keys of their Town in a Silver Diſh. The
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:63304:159"/>Chancellor, in the King's Name, Aſſur'd them of His Maieſty's Clemency and Affection; and Read, with an Audible Voice the Oath of Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which they took Kneeling: After which they Preſented, according to Cuſtom, a Purſe full of Ducats to His Majeſty, who was pleaſed to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Order of Knighthood upon ſome of them. All the People being about the Throne, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who had the Office of Treaſurer, ſcatter'd ſome Money amonſt them; which Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality was Proclaimed by Great Acclamations of Joy, and <hi>Long</hi> Live <hi>Friderick Auguſtus</hi> Our KING.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dyet</hi> which was Called ſome time before Met at <hi>Cracow,</hi> according to Cuſtom; and, at their firſt Meeting, ſome of the Deputies of the <hi>French</hi> Faction made ſome Reflections on the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellan of <hi>Cracow,</hi> and other Senators, who had advisd the Haſtning of the King's Coronation; which, as they ſaid, ought to have been deferred till the great Diſpute concerning the Crown was accommodated, to which, they ſaid, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and his Party were enclined; but they were Silenc'd by the reſt of the Deputies, who would not hear ſuch Diſcourſes. The Conteſt about the Choice of a Mareſchal went ſo far, that the Sabres were drawn, but at laſt the Matter was Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Staroſt <hi>Minsky</hi> of <hi>Lithuania</hi> was Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen on the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Dyet</hi> went on upon Publick Buſineſs.</p>
            <p>Some days after the Coronation the King held a Great Council of War, wherein it was Reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſend a Detachment of His Forces towards <hi>Dantzick,</hi> to prevent the Prince of <hi>Conty</hi>'s Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and another to <hi>Warſaw,</hi> to Secure the Place, and Diſperſe the Rebels, which was accordingly done, the King in ending to repair, in few ways,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:63304:159"/>to <hi>Warſaw</hi> at the Head of His Army. But the Primate having received Advice of His Majeſty's Coronation, and of His deſign to March to <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw,</hi> cauſed the Corps of the Late King, with all the Artillery and Ammunition of the Place to be Embarked on the <hi>Viſtula</hi> for <hi>Jarreſlow,</hi> deſigning to retire himſelf, with the Mareſchal of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Party, to <hi>Lowitz,</hi> a Strong Place in a Moraſs, belonging to his Eminence, which he did few days after.</p>
            <p>The whole Party was much Surpris'd at the News of the King's Coronation, for they did not think that the <hi>Saxons</hi> would have proceeded to it, becauſe of the Reaſons I have mention'd; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they were not Diſheartned; and they Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd the Nobility of Upper <hi>Poland</hi> to Meet at <hi>Lenovi,</hi> under the Command of the Caſtellan of <hi>Caliſh:</hi> In the Lower <hi>Poland</hi> at <hi>Zawickhorſt,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Command of the Palatine of <hi>Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>z;</hi> but the <hi>Rendeſvous</hi> of the <hi>Lithuanians</hi> was left to the Prince <hi>Sapieha,</hi> who was to have the Chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand till the Arrival of the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who was daily expected.</p>
            <p>That Prince ſet out form <hi>Dunkirk</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> on board the Chevalier <hi>Bart,</hi> and Arrived at <hi>Dantzick</hi> the <hi>25th.</hi> He ſent a Gentleman to give Notice of his Arrival to the Magiſtrates, and deſire a free Paſſage through the City: To which they Anſwer'd, That they had a great Reſpect for his Highneſs, but that the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> having been Crowned, they could do no more for him, than give him the Liberty to come aſhore himſelf with his Servants alone, but not ſuffer any Officers or Soldiers to Land, or Paſs through their City. The Prince was very much Mortifyed at the Anſwer of the Magiſtrates, but his Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion increaſed much on the <hi>29th</hi> of the ſame
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:63304:160"/>Month, that he was an Eye-witneſs of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming his Competitor with all imaginable So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, which was a great diſappointment to his Party, who thought to have had their Rendeſvous in that Place. They had alſo bought ſeveral Pieces of Cannon and Ammunition, but the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates would not ſuffer them to be carry'd away, and forbid the Inhabitants, upon Pain of Death, to Sell any Arms or Ammunition to Strangers. The Primate came Incognito to Confer with his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with Five or Six other Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the King thought fit to ſend Circular Letters to all the Provinces of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well to notify his Coronation, as to Anſwer ſome Calumnies raiſed by his Enemies; The Subſtance of thoſe Letters were That his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty being by the Free Choice of the Kingdom Elected and Crowned King of <hi>Poland,</hi> he was concerned to find there ſhould be any Perſons ſo much Enemies of their Country, as to go about to Violate the Rights of the Gentry and diſturb the Publick Peace: That he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood they Complain'd of his having Poſſeſs'd himſelf of the Caſtle of <hi>Cracow,</hi> and brought Forces into the Kingdom; but that he had done nothing therein but with the advice of the Senators and Great Officers of the Crown, and that the Troops he had with him were no more than were neceſſary for the Security of his Perſon: That notwithſtanding the unreaſonable Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Adverſe Party, he had uſed all endeavours to gain them by fair Means, but the ſame not having had the effect he hoped for; his Majeſty Places his Confidence in the Protection of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, and doe's not Doubt but they who Choſe him King will be careful to maintain their own Honour and Liberty.</p>
            <pb n="297" facs="tcp:63304:160"/>
            <p>Immediatly after the Coronation the Caſtellan of <hi>Cracow</hi> was ſent to the Army, who having receiv'd the Arrears due to them declar'd they were ready to obey his Majeſtys Orders. The <hi>Primate</hi> had ſent ſome Deputies to ingage them to come over to his Party, but he having been inform'd at <hi>lemberg</hi> of the diſpoſition of the Troops, they did not think fit to venture to go to the Camp, for fear the General ſhould proceed againſt them as Publick Enemies.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtood the affairs of <hi>Poland</hi> towards the latter end of <hi>September</hi> 1697. and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Obſtinacy of the <hi>Primate</hi> and his Party, one may reaſonably believe that the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> will find himſelf diſappointed, his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor having many great advantages over him: for altho one would ſuppoſe, which is certainly falſe, that their Parties in the Republick are equal, yet the Electors Territories bordering upon <hi>Poland,</hi> and all the Neighbouring Princes as <hi>Sweden, Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covy,</hi> the <hi>Emperor, Brandenburgh,</hi> &amp;c. having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd for him, his Party muſt needs prevail up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> who has nothing to rely upon, but the ſupplies from <hi>France,</hi> which will be very uncertain conſidering the diſtance from <hi>France,</hi> to <hi>Poland,</hi> and the dangers of the Sea in this Seaſon of the year.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Reader</hi> doe's perhaps expect that we ſhould inquire which of the two Elections is conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Laws, or whether either of them may be ſaid to be ſo, which is neither improbable nor impoſſible; but this inquity would be uſeleſs, for as things are now diſpoſed, there is no likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that this Affair will be decided by the Laws of Equity. However we may venture to ſay that
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:63304:161"/>there were ſome irregularities in both Elections, but much more in that of the Prince of <hi>Conti,</hi> and that the irregular proceedings in the other, were chiefly occaſioned by the partiality of the <hi>Primate.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> Party exclaim very much againſt the Biſhop of <hi>Cujavia</hi> for having Proclaim'd the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of <hi>Saxony,</hi> but whatever they may ſay this Prelate is not to be blamed as to that point. 'Tis true it belongs to the Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Gneſna</hi> to Proclaim the Kings of <hi>Poland,</hi> but this is to be underſtood when the Election is Unanimous, for if it were in the Power of the <hi>Primate</hi> alone to Proclaim a King, the Election would never be Free, and he might at that rate Proclaim whom he ſhould pleaſe. It appears by the foregoing account that the Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> had the Majority of Voices on his ſide, and this is enough to juſtify their proceedings, ſeeing the <hi>Primate</hi> and his Party ought to have Submitted.</p>
            <p>Money being the only Soul that enlivens the Affairs of <hi>Poland,</hi> it were more to the purpoſe to enquire which of the two Competitors can ſpare moſt money, for let their Right be what it will, the firſt who wants money, will be in the wrong, and loſe the Crown; but the Caſe is now different: the Elector is Crowned, and has a good Army of his own and needs not to rely intirely on the Fidelity of his Party. That Prince is certainly very Rich, but yet, his Purſe bears no proportion with that of the <hi>French</hi> King, who having already ſpent ſo much, will neglect nothing at all to ſet the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> upon the Throne. The Winter drawing nigh, the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea will be Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navigable, and likely none of the <hi>German</hi> Princes will give him leave to march an Army into <hi>Poland</hi> through their Territories, ſo that the Prince
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:63304:161"/>of <hi>Conti</hi> has nothing to rely upon but his Party, which is very precarious: for after all 'tis likely that the <hi>Poles</hi> will open their eyes, and conſider that they have nothing to fear from <hi>France,</hi> whereas they muſt expect a continual War with <hi>Germany</hi> if this preſent King receives any diſgrace, and is oblig'd to retire into his own Country; inſomuch that altho they ſhould beat him out of the Kingdom, the controverſy would not be at an end, for his Dominions border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Poland,</hi> he may invade them at any time.</p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> are ſo ſtrong, that one would think they ſhould have already prevailed upon the <hi>Poles;</hi> but their Mercenary Nobility is Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enc'd only by Gold, and does not care for the Publick Good, ſo long as they find their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Intereſt in Inteſtine Diviſions.</p>
            <p>The Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> who had a great Share in the Election of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> keeps now an exact Neutrality; but thoſe Refin'd Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans will ſoon Declare for one of the Competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and doubtleſs for the Preſent King, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the Great Advantage they expect from the Converſion of that Prince to their Religion, which certainly weakens much the Proteſtant Intereſt in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Long Continuance of the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> in the Road of <hi>Dantzick,</hi> without offering to go on Shoar, is an <hi>Ill Omen</hi> for his Affairs; and ſeeing his Party have reſolved to give him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Title of <hi>Protector of the Religion and the Liberties of Poland;</hi> 'tis doubted whether he will Accept of it, it being a Tacit Confeſſion that
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:63304:162"/>his Election was Illegal; but if he does not ſcruple to take it, 'tis likely that he will make himſelf ſuch a Sort of <hi>Protector</hi> as <hi>Oliver Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> was; and, perhaps the <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> of this Age will ſay of him, in caſe he Succeeds, what was ſaid of the Succeſſor of <hi>Julius Caeſar, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus Arma, quae in Antonium acceperat, in Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicam vertit:</hi> And really I would not blame him for it, for he muſt needs ſpend as much Money as the Crown of <hi>Poland</hi> is Worth, and perhaps a great deal more. But I muſt give over Conjectures, time will ſoon bring this Great Controverſy to an End.</p>
            <p>The Reader muſt not expect here a Caracter of the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> this undertaking is above my reach, therefore I muſt break off my Diſcourſe after having obſerv'd that he was Born <hi>May 12th.</hi> 1670. Second Son to <hi>John George</hi> Elector of <hi>Saxony</hi> and of <hi>Anne Sophia</hi> Siſter of the Preſent King of <hi>Denmark.</hi> He has made ſeveral Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns on the <hi>Rhine</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> and after his Brothers Death, he Commanded in Chief the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Army in <hi>Hungary</hi> in the years 1695. and 1696. and has ſhewed on all Occaſions an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Bravery. He Marry'd before he was Elector the Daughter of the <hi>Markgrave</hi> of <hi>Bareith</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>Brandenburgh.</hi> His Majeſty is of a very ſtrong Conſtitution and parhaps the Strongeſt Man alive.</p>
